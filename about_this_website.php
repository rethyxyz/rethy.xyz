<h1>About This Website</h1> <hr>
<p>
    <a href="https://rethy.xyz">https://rethy.xyz</a> is about creating <b>useful</b> content. Most is computer related, but I also share other things related to learning, like <a href="visual_media/index.php">visual media</a>, <a href="music/index.php">music</a>, <a href="literature/index.php">literature</a>, and whatever else I deem worthy.
</p>

<p>
    I try my best to trim the fat that is the majority of modern day content, keeping only the important stuff (or whatever I feel is important). You'll notice that I ameliorate articles daily to increase specificity. This is because modern day writers, especially academic, put an emphasis on <b>difficulty</b> and <b>wankery</b> instead of <b>understanding</b> and <b>education</b>, completely ostracizing those <i>not-in-the-know</i> to begin with. I also do this because of changing opinions, and information.
</p>

<p>
    I prefer to keep the website in Web 1.0-like style to keep focus on content. Take note that some articles are found in multiple category pages as there is some crossover.
