<h1>About This Website</h1> <hr>

<p><a href="https://rethy.xyz">https://rethy.xyz</a> is about creating <b>useful</b> content. Most is computer related, but I also share other things related to learning, like <a href="visual_media/index.php">visual media</a>, <a href="music/index.php">music</a>, <a href="literature/index.php">literature</a>, and likely more whenever I feel like it.</p>

<p>I try my best to trim the fat that is the majority of modern day content, keeping only the important stuff. You'll notice that I ameliorate articles on a daily basis to increase specificity. This is because modern day writers, especially academic, put an emphasis on <b>difficulty</b> and <b>wankery</b> instead of <b>understanding</b> and <b>education</b>, completely ostracizing those <i>not-in-the-know</i> to begin with. I also do this because of changing opinions, and information.</p>

<p>I prefer to keep the website in Web 1.0 style to keep focus on content, not <i>"pretty design"</i>. Take note that some articles are found in multiple category pages as there is some crossover.</p>

<p><b><center>All content is free from frills and ulterior motives, as it will always be.</center></b></p>
