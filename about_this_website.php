<h1>About This Website</h1> <hr>
<p><a href="https://rethy.xyz">https://rethy.xyz</a> is about sharing information. Most is computer related, but I also share other things related to learning, like <a href="visual_media/index.php">visual media</a>, <a href="music/index.php">music</a>, <a href="literature/index.php">literature</a>, and whatever else I deem worthy.</p>

<p>I try my best to trim the fat that is the majority of modern day content, keeping only the important stuff (or whatever I deem important).</p>

<p>You'll notice I ameliorate articles daily to increase specificity. This is because modern day writers, especially in academic fields, put an emphasis on <b>difficulty</b> and <b>wankery</b> instead of <b>understanding</b> and <b>education</b>, completely ostracizing those <i>not-in-the-know</i> from the start. It's also to keep information recent, and because of changing opinions.</p>

<p>I prefer to keep this site minimal to keep focus on content, and to let people with bad hardware browse freely. The only technology used for this site is CSS, HTML, and PHP (only for includes and auto-modification dates).</p>

<p>Take note that some articles are found in multiple category pages as there is occasionally some crossover. Note as well, that I use emojis as a sort of mnemonic device. It's not because I'm a zoomer bastard.</p>
