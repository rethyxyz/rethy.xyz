<h1>About This Website</h1> <hr>
<p><a href="https://rethy.xyz">https://rethy.xyz</a> is about sharing information. Most is computer related, but I also share other things related to learning, like <a href="visual_media/index.php">visual media</a>, <a href="music/index.php">music</a>, <a href="literature/index.php">literature</a>, and whatever else I deem worthy that isn't listed here.</p>

<p>I try my best to trim the fat that is the majority of modern day content, keeping only the important stuff.</p>

<p>You'll notice I ameliorate articles daily to increase specificity. This is because modern day writers, especially ones in educational fields, put emphasis on <b>difficulty</b> and <b>wankery</b> instead of <b>understanding</b> and <b>education</b>, completely ostracizing those <i>not-in-the-know</i> from the start. I also to keep information recent, and because of my changing opinions.</p>

<p>I prefer to keep this site as "human" as possible to keep focus on content, to let people with bad hardware browse freely, and to allow easy movement to and fro.</p>

<p>The only technology used for this site is CSS, HTML, and PHP for includes and auto-updating modification dates.</p>

<p>Take note some articles are found in multiple category pages as there is occasionally some crossover. Note as well, that I use emojis as a sort of mnemonic device, not because I'm a zoomer bastard.</p>
