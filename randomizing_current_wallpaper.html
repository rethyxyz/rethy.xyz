			<h1>Randomizing Current Wallpaper in Linux</h1>
			<p>
				<small><b>Created: 2020-12-27 | Modified: 2020-12-27</b></small>

			<p>You can find the code for the script <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rethyxyz/Scripts/master/randomize_wallpaper.py">here</a>. Feel free to change, modify, or copy.</p>
			<p>
				I decided to write a program to select an image at random from my wallpapers directory and set it as my wallpaper.
				Here's how it works:
				<ul>
				<li><code>username</code> variable is defined through a function return</li>
				<li>All sub-dirs found inside of the main wallpaper dir defined inside of a list called <code>paths</code>.</li>
				<li>One of the sub-dirs is chosen at random to be the main dirs and is assigned to a variable called <code>sub-dirs</code></li>
				<li>All file names inside of the dir are appended to a list defined as <code>all_files</code></li>
				<li>The wallpaper is then chosen by selecting a random index from the <code>all_files</code> list</li>
				<li>The wallpaper is set using <code>os.system</code> plus the path and the wallpaper file</li>
				</ul>
				I run this script from my <code>.xinitrc</code> once upon startup, and have it bound to <code>modifier</code>+<code>Shift</code>+<code>R</code> in my <code>config.h</code> (in dwm) in case I want to auto-set another at some point.
