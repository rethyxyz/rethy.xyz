        Movie about an (old) man who ages backwards. Born as a small, old man.
        Dies as a baby. All you need to know. You don't get anything valuable
        from the movie. It's just one of those "feel good" types, I suppose.
      </p>

        I thought that the idea was interesting, but it ended up with many plot
        holes, and didn't go into his condition as much as I'd like it to.
        Though, the point of the film was to simply portray what would happen
        if a person were to age in reverse. It isn't science fiction, so it
        isn't about the science behind his peculiar condition. I recognize
        that.
      </p>

        The romantic portions were too much for me, but as I said, I recognize
        I'm not the target demographic, nor will I be ever be.

        I did enjoy the portions during the portrayal of his early life. It
        eventually got into his teens (in age, not in physical appearance),
        which is when he started working on a tugboat led by an interesting
        captain. This captain and he became close friends until he died in the
        war alongside Benjamin (the main character). As I see it, this captain
        character was a device used to bring the protagonist into maturity.
        This was an interesting time in the movie, but things progressively got
        worse. It's like they forgot that he aged backwards and turned the
        entire thing into a sappy romance novel, only once again remembering
        his condition at the very end. It was alright, but not worth the hype.
        The acting was good, though. No issues with that. Just bad execution of
        the story.
