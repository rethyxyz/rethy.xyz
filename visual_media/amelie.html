<p>Amelie, being one of my favorite movies, is something I've seen plenty of times. I know quite a bit about. The think I enjoy the most, is character that is Amelie, being a sort of Machiavellianistic psychopath, but one who's selfish but does good. I'll make my case later.</p>

<p>It's classified as a "comedy", but it shouldn't be. All the humor is the opposite of slapstick, being driven in a sort of dark way. Dry as hell. Besides that, there isn't a lot of comedic value, at least not in an "American sense", , not that anyone watched it for that.</p>

<p>Overall, it's a great movie that makes heavy use of character development to bring forth empathy for each character.</p><br>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>As a young child, Amelie was under a lot of stress almost entirely brought on by her neurotic mother and distant father. She was home schooled after her father believed she had a heart defect (something actually caused by anxiety). As a coping mechanism, she started living inside her head through her creativity. To process troubling situations and her odd lifestyle, Amelie started making up stories, one surrounding her comatose neighbor, who to her was simply sleeping now so she wouldn't have to later in life. This is because like her mother, she is quite neurotic (demonstrated by an eye twitch they both share, which I'll get into later).</p>

<p>Eventually, her mother died in Notre dame after being stuck by an exchange student from Quebec suiciding off the Cathedral. This affected her father, who ended up becoming only more unsociable. The effect caused Amelie to regress even further into a made up reality.</p>

<p>Years pass, and eventually she left home. No job prospects, no life experience, only the desire to exist elsewhere than she started. She ends up as a waitress in Montmartre, France, which is where the main parts of the movie take place.</p>



<h2>Subtleties</h2>
<p>These key events play huge parts in the movie. Like, the movie is built upon them. They are the foundation of the story.</p>



<h3>Eye Twitch</h3>
<p>Something I noticed, which says a lot about Amelie's charcter, is she and her mother's eye twitch. It's something that happened during times of stress or discomfort. It shows how they're actually both alike, even though they were distant from each other. They both share the fact that they're neurotic. This is a tiny detail that only appears once in the movie but says a lot about her as a character. I'm sure most people didn't even notice, but I could be wrong.</p>



<h3>Scene Coloration</h3>
<p>
Green. Something I've noticed is the heavy use of muddy green and brownish colors. There is almost always an undertone of these colors in every scene.<br>

<p>It's probably some psychological effect caused by the color green which makes someone feel nostalgia or some weird bullshit like that, but I cannot be asked to look into it right now. I'll look into this someday</p>

<p>TODO: Look into the green tint effect</p>



<h3>Hidden Things</h3>
<p>I noticed that in this scene, you can see people looking out the window from the shop behind.</p>

Maybe they were actors for the scene, or maybe they were people watching the filming take place. I'll probably never know. Either way, interesting.

<h2>Amelie: The Light-Hearted Machiavellianistic Psychopath</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Gas-lighting
	<ul>
	<li>The shop produce stand owner</li>
	<li>Her father; Gnome scene</li>
	</ul>
<li>Self-interested</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Getting the character Gorgette together with tape dude in the cafe. Something totally out of a personal self-interest: Fun. She didn't really think that they'd neccesarily be a "good match", she just wanted to test the hook-up theory explained by her boss.</li>
	<li>She only continued doing good deeds because she got good reactions, in a way, it was for power of a good use</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
</p>
<p>What she does is different than the typical psychopath, as she does them for good, even though they still are for herself. Yet, she still fits on the Machiavellianistic psychopathic spectrum. Everything she does, is to make herself feel powerful, and is done in self interest. She wouldn't be doing it if it didn't make her feel something, as she said herself.</p>

<p>This is the best part of the movie, in my opinion. The juxtaposition between the light- and dark-hearted psychopath. She takes the "Dark Triad" and flips it upside down. Very rarely do you see these types of psychopaths portrayed in films. Typically it's the power hungry murderer, like in American Psycho.</p>



<h2>Disinteresting Things in the Movie</h2>
<p>Rom-com. I had no idea until I looked up the genre of the movie. I wouldn't classify it as that, even after watching it. The whole love interest stuff only plays a small part.</p>
