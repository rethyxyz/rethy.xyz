      <p>Amelie, being one of my favorite movies, is something I've seen plenty of times, and know quite a bit about. Most of all, I enjoy the character that is Amelie, being a sort of Machiavellianistic psychopath, but atypically one who outputs pro-social behavior. I'll start my case later on.</p>

      <p>The film is classified as a "comedy", but I belive it shouldn't be. The humor is opposite of slapstick, being driven in a darker way. Dry as hell. Besides that, there isn't a lot of comedic value, at least not in the "American sense", not that anyone watched it for that.</p>

      <p>Overall, it's a great piece that focuses heavily on character development to bring forth empathy for each and every character displayed in the film.</p> <br>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>As a young child, Amelie was under a lot of stress almost entirely brought on by her neurotic mother and distant father. Early on, she started to be home schooled after her father found she had a heart defect (something later on found to be attributed to anxiety, not a defect). As a coping mechanism, she started living inside her head through creative outlets. One being to process troubling situations. Amelie started making up stories, one surrounding her comatose neighbor, who to her was simply sleeping now so she wouldn't have to later in life. This is because, like her mother, she is quite neurotic (demonstrated by an eye twitch they both share, which I'll get into later).</p>

      <p>Eventually, her mother died in Notre dame after being stuck by an exchange student from Quebec suiciding off the famous Cathedral. This affected her father, who ended up only becoming more unsociable. The effect caused Amelie to regress even further into her made up reality.</p>

      <p>Years passed, and eventually she left home. No job prospects, no life experience, only the desire to exist elsewhere than where she started. She eventually ended up as a waitress in Montmartre, France, which is where the main parts of the movie take place.</p>

      <h2>Subtleties</h2>
      <p>These tiny key events play a huge part in the atmosphere and magic of the movie. Like, the movie is built upon them. They are the very foundation of the story, and the hard structural materials of the cinematography.</p>

      <h3>Eye Twitch</h3>
      <p>Something which says a lot about Amelie's charcter, is she and her mother's eye twitch. It's something that happened during times of stress or discomfort. It shows how they're actually both alike, even though they were always distant from each other until her demise. They both share the fact that they're neurotic. This is a tiny detail that only appears once in the movie, but says a lot about Amelie as a character. I'm sure most didn't notice, as I don't think I did upon my first viewing.</p>

      <h3>Scene Coloration</h3>
      <p>Something I've noticed is the heavy use of muddy green and brownish colors. There is almost always an undertone of these colors in every scene.</p>

      <small><b>Yes, I see that this was taken outside, but it's a conscious scene choice (obviously).</b></small>

      <small><b>Note how her hair reflects green.</b></small>
      </center>
      </p><br>

      <p>
      <center>
      <img src="files\amelie_3.jpg" width=50% /><br><br>
      <small><b>Green is reflected on skin and background.</b></small>
      </center>
      </p><br>

      <p>
      <center>
      <img src="files\amelie_4.jpg" width=50% /><br><br>
      <small><b>View the background, hair, skin, and of course, the trees.</b></small>
      </center>
      </p><br>

      <p>It's probably some psychological effect caused by the color green which makes someone feel nostalgia or some weird bullshit like that, but I cannot be asked to look into it right now. I'll look into this someday</p>



      <h3>Hidden Things</h3>
      <p>I noticed that in this scene, you can see people looking out the window from the shop behind.</p>

      <p>
          <center>

              <small><b>To the right.</b></small>
          </center>
      </p><br>

      <p>Maybe they were actors for the scene, or maybe they were people watching the filming take place. I'll probably never know. Either way, interesting.</p>



      <h2>Amelie: The Light-Hearted Machiavellianistic Psychopath</h2>
      <p>
      <ul>
      <li>Gas-lighting
      <ul>
      <li>The shop produce stand owner</li>
      <li>Her father; Gnome scene</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Self-interested</li>
      <ul>
      <li>Getting the character Gorgette together with tape recorder guy in the cafe. Something totally out of a personal self-interest; Being fun. She didn't really think that they'd neccesarily be a "good match", she just wanted to test the hook-up theory explained to her by her boss.</li>
      <li>She only continued doing good deeds because she got good reactions, in a way, it was for power, but in a good way.</li>
      </ul>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>What she does is different than the typical Psychopath, as she does it for "good", even though they still are selfish. Yet, she still fits on the Machiavellianistic psychopathic spectrum. Everything she does, is to make herself feel powerful, and is done in pure self-interest. She wouldn't be doing it if it didn't make her feel something, as she said herself.</p>

      <p>This is the best part of the movie, in my opinion. The juxtaposition between the light- and dark-hearted Psychopath. She takes the "Dark Triad" and flips it upside down. Very rarely do you see these types of psychopaths portrayed in films. Typically it's the power hungry murderer, like Patrick Bateman in American Psycho.</p>



      <h2>Disinteresting Things in the Movie</h2>
      <p>Rom-com. I had no idea until I looked up the genre of the movie. I wouldn't classify it as that, even after watching it. The whole love interest stuff only plays a small part.</p> <hr>
