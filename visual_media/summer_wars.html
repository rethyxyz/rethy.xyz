        Summer wars is a stylized anime about an all encompasing "virtual
        world" where everything (economy, work, job, socialization) is based
        off of a centralized computer platform called Oz.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can probably predict that the platform gets hacked by some bad
        guy(s) and shit goes bad for everyone. In the end, the platform is
        saved, and the guy gets the girl... It's the typical story.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don't care for the story much, as it's just alright. I prefer the
        cool visuals; Specifically the 2000s computer style.

        An office space. These two are sysadmins that work on Oz. They're using
        some sort of Windows Vista-like machine. You can tell it is because of
        the wallpaper, which is Aero-like (it's a Windows theme), and the time
        period. The time period was a year into Windows 7's release (2009),
        which makes sense that it would be Vista. If you know anything about
        offices, they have a tendency to wait as long as possible to upgrade
        their internal operating systems to the newest alternatives.
