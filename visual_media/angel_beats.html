        About dead people who live in a limbo dimension at a high school. These
        people end up fighting against a supposed angel who (they claim) want
        to make them disappear from this dimension. They fight the angel to
        stay in this dimension. They don't know what happens when they die
        there, and they don't want to find out. That's really all you need to
        know.

        Classic late 2000s anime. If you're anyone who reads anime forums or
        charts, you've probably seen someone mention this, or have seen it
        yourself.

        The typical episode run does goes as follows: The Protagonist wakes up,
        goes to class, during/after class learns a sub-main character's sob
        story, the whole team does a "raid" to get food, items, etc, and the
        day completes on a positive note. I make it sound mundane, but the
        smaller things throughout are what make it so good.

        <b>Unpredictably funny</b>. I usually don't care for that classic anime
        style banter, as I feel like it doesn't translate into English speaking
        attitudes well, but this show is actually funny. The best being - and
        the only one that stuck with me till now - is the rocket propulsion
        scenes. They may not be funny on their own, as the unexpectedness is
        that makes the joke, but you can watch it above.

        Good overall, bad ending. It wasn't realistic, and was likely made so
        they could carry on the show more sequels (as shown by the numerous
        trashy sequels, which I likely won't be watching).
