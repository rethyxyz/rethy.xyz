      <h1>Apetor</h1>
      <p><b><small>Created: 2021-02-16 | Modified: 2021-07-15</small></b></p> <hr>

      <p><b>Apetor</b>: One of the best story telling experiences on YouTube.</p>

      <p>The man running Apetor is <b>Tor Eckhoff</b>. I first viewed his work during college. Not sure how, exactly, but probably by the grace of YouTube algorithm. Upon discovery, I was instantly hooked. I mean really hooked. Not by the humor, but by the simplicity. Most of his videos are outdoors, taking place in Norway. He really makes good use of framing and the illusion of fluent movement through smart cuts b-roll footage.</p>

      <p>The day I discovered him, I watched almost every video that night, no exaggeration (okay, maybe some exaggeration). The next day, or week or so, I showed the channel to a friend. He was intrigued too, so we then viewed a whole bunch of them together, waiting for the rest of our friend group to get ready for a 7:00 PM trip to the bar. This became a topic brought up often between him and I, asking if I had seen the newest video, my views on it, or if there was a new one coming out...</p>

      <p>His alcohol consumption and symbolism is the comedic staple defining his channel. In almost every video, the man takes a hearty swig of Vodka and ends it with an "ahhhh", the vocal signature to accompany all. He usually drinks a Norweigian branded Vodka called Vikingfjord.</p><br>

      </p> <br>

      <p>He also has the occasional tendency to drink a whole assortment of Polish, Russian, and Slavic Vodkas (you can view them in the photo below). This is something I can appreciate, as a seasoned drinker myself, though I'm mostly a malt liquor conniseur (Colt 45, and JR 6.0, a New Brunswick classic (this is a joke by the way, malt liquor is cheap shit)). The man must have quite the tolerance by now, but there's not reason to speculate.</p>

      <p>He rarely speaks proper words in his videos despite being a fully capable English speaker. Instead, he utters Mister bean-like noises, something on the usual video itinerary. The one time he truly spoke for a long while was during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEQAwEquyCc">car review video.</a></p><br>

        As I was writing this, I ended up trailing off to refresh my memory.
        While doing so, I decided I should include my favorite video, being the
        classic <i>"Making a Tartre Sandwich"</i>. I knew this instantly. I
        love the way it portrays the simple enjoyments of life. It's good to
        see people consuming basic food, using natural ingredients.
