<p>Apetor: One of my favorite YouTube channels. The one running the channel is named Tor Eckhoff. I first found him during college. Not sure how exactly, probably just YouTube recommendations. Upon finding him, I was instantly hooked. Not just by the humor, but by his simple yet stylistic film making. Also, the landscapes, of course. Most of his videos are outdoors, taking place in Norway. He really makes good use of framing and makes an illusion of fluent movement through smart cuts.</p>

<p>The day I discovered him, I watched almost every video that night, no exaggeration. The next day, or week or so, I showed the channel to a friend. He was intrigued too, so we decided to view a bunch of them together, waiting for the rest of our friend group to get ready for the bar. Quite fitting, eh? This became a topic brought up often between him and I, asking if I had seen the newest video, my views on it, if there was a new one out...</p>

<p>The whole alcohol stuff is pretty great too. In almost every video, the man takes a hearty swig of Vodka and ends it with an "ahhhh", something that's signature to his channel. Typically it's a Norweigian brand called Vikingfjord,</p><br>

<p>but also he has a tendency to drink a whole assortment of Polish, Russian, and some others (you can view them in the photo below). This is something I can appreciate as a seasoned drinker myself, though I'm mostly a conniseur of fine malt liquor (Colt 45, and JR 6.0, a New Brunswick classic). The man must have quite the tolerance by now.</p><br>

<p>He rarely talks in his videos despite being able to speak English well. Instead, he does a Mister bean-esque noise, something that has become part of his usual video vocabulary. The only time he truly spoke for a long while was during a car review video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEQAwEquyCc">You can watch it here.</a></p>

<p>Even as I was writing this, I ended up trailing off to rewatch more of his videos. While doing so, I decided I should include my favorite video, being "Making a Tartre Sandwich". I knew this instantly. I love the way it portrays some of the simple enjoyments in life: Drinking, eating natural foods, and easy going. The freedom of being alone, away from the watchful eye. It's nice for a change, especially if you live in a busy society. Information overload, <i>us-vs-them</i> mentality, fear mongering, these are all issues we face. Sometimes it's nice to take a break. I guess you could say Apetor gives that to you.</p><br>

<p>Pure simplicity. I understand I dug a little too deep here, but no matter. I just like to admire the simplicity of his videos.</p> <hr>
