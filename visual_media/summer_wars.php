<p>Summer wars is a stylized anime about an all encompasing "virtual world" where everything (economy, work, job, socialization) is based off of a centralized computer platform called Oz.</p>

<p>You can probably predict that the platform gets hacked by some bad guy(s) and shit goes bad for everyone. In the end, the platform is saved, and the guy gets the girl... It's the typical story.</p>

<p>I don't care for the story much, as it's just alright. I prefer the cool visuals; Specifically the 2000s computer style.</p>

<p>An office space. These two are sysadmins that work on Oz. They're using some sort of Windows Vista-like machine. You can tell it is because of the wallpaper, which is Aero-like (it's a Windows theme), and the time period. The time period was a year into Windows 7's release (2009), which makes sense that it would be Vista. If you know anything about offices, they have a tendency to wait as long as possible to upgrade their internal operating systems to the newest alternatives.</p>
