I have an odd writing style. I've been trying to hone it over the years, and feel like a have gotten to a notable point. At least, compared to before.

Prior to this <i>honing-of</i>, I would write like most people. Prioritizing word count, vivid word choice, low repetition, etc. Now: almost bullet point form. I prioritize compactness and brevity, without getting into that academic style, which is worst of all, as it works for no one aside from <i>those-in-the-know</i>. It's hard to learn anything from academic writers, because they make things as hard as possible for bragging rights, or are tone deaf to <i>normal</i> people. There's no need to write like that, but I understand when it's for journals, when you need to prioritize word count as you can only take up so much space. Though, most are people who are not writing for academic journals. Those are the worst types.

My style features quickness in the hardest of subjects. I don't like long lines, or wordiness. Some people may see my style as "little in content", or "lacking in subject matter", but they are missing the point. My writing contains all the information needed to get the point across, no more, no less. I produce no excess.

People that think "it's long, so it's good", are equating length to skill. This is a trash idea pushed around by humans in all areas of life. It's a very primal, competitive gene, carried on through the years. This is really seen in programming fields. This is the philosophy of Suckless Software, a group of like-minded extremist C programmers whom emphasize speed and simplicity in their computer code.

  Suckless Manifest:

  <blockquote>Many (open source) hackers are proud if they achieve large amounts of code, because they believe the more lines of code they've written, the more progress they have made. The more progress they have made, the more skilled they are. This is simply a delusion.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Most hackers actually don't care much about code quality. Thus, if they get something working which seems to solve a problem, they stick with it. If this kind of software development is applied to the same source code throughout its entire life-cycle, we're left with large amounts of code, a totally screwed code structure, and a flawed system design. This is because of a lack of conceptual clarity and integrity in the development process.</blockquote>

<p>
  <blockquote>Code complexity is the mother of bloated, hard to use, and totally inconsistent software. With complex code, problems are solved in suboptimal ways, valuable resources are endlessly tied up, performance slows to a halt, and vulnerabilities become a commonplace. The only solution is to scrap the entire project and rewrite it from scratch.</blockquote>

<p>I took some of my early ideas from David Foster Wallace, the author of Infinite Jest, whom once said (paraphrasing): "When you start noticing how unneeded much of each phrase contents are, you start obsessing over minification", something he did for years (if you've read Infinite Jest, it doesn't show).</p>

I tend to mix and match UK and US literary rules, opting to use whatever I feel is quicker. Some examples enclude The Oxford Comma, and color over colour/airplane over aeroplane. Why the Oxford Comma? Well, because it's always exact. While sometimes it may be redundant, it will always increase specificity, something I do before all else.
