<h1>Literature</h1>
<p>Covering novels, novellas, technical documents, research papers, and comic books, but am not limiting myself to just that. By the word literature, I don't just mean pieces leaning towards that oh-so well known artistic style (which is the old style definition of the word), but any collection of written (either by hand or through typewriter (including keyboards)) work.</p>
