<h1>Literature</h1>
<p>About pieces of writing written in the English language. I cover novels, novellas, technical documents, research papers, and comics, but am not limiting myself to just that.</p>

<p>I recently read this comic book by Scott Pilgrim creator called Lost at Sea. I didn't enjoy it very much. It was a quick read - took around an hour - but was lacking content. I enjoyed Scott Pilgrim versus the World, and have read it a couple of time, but won't be reading this one again.</p>

<p>My overview of the Unix Hater's Handbook.</p>
<p>If you're a self-proclaimed Linux <i>"master"</i> like myself, you've already heard the author's arguments. Basically, they bring up some good points, but they're nothing new.</p>

<h1>Lists</h1>

<p><a href="books_ive_read.php">Books I've Read</a></p>
<p>Literally just a list of every single book I've read. Or, at least, every single book I can recall reading. I'll be sure to add more in the future, whenever I get around to that.</p>
