<p>I recently read this comic book by Scott Pilgrim creator called Lost at Sea. I didn't enjoy it very much. It was a quick read - took around an hour - but was lacking content. I enjoyed Scott Pilgrim versus the World, and have read it a couple of time, but won't be reading this one again.</p>

<p>To say the least, Lost at Sea was mundane, but not in a good, comfy and calming way. Oh, well. I'm sure I'll still end up reading anything else he puts out.</p>
