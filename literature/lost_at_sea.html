        I recently read this comic book by Scott Pilgrim creator Brian Lee
        O'Malley called Lost at Sea. I didn't enjoy it much. It was a quick
        read - took around an hour - but was lacking content. I enjoyed Scott
        Pilgrim versus the World, and have read it a couple of time, but won't
        be reading this one again.

      <p>
        To say the least, Lost at Sea was mundane, but not in a good, comfy and
        calming way. Oh, well. I'm sure I'll still end up reading anything else
        he puts out none the less.
