<h1>Foo Bar Bad</h1>

<p>Have you ever learned something from a good example effortlessly, other times getting literally nothing from another? Have you ever noticed the latter seems to be the <b>foo</b> <b>bar</b> example? This is the world of bad examples. This is something especially prevalent in computing sectors, and I'll say why.</p>

<p>This is the worst. Nothing is grasped from this. What these examples should be, are things to make real world connections, not this <b>foo</b>, <b>bar</b>, <b>baz</b>, unintelligible mess.</p>

<p><center><b><small>Others agree. I'm not the only one.</small></b></center></p> <br>

<p>The reason we started doing this, was because it's something invoked from an old MIT terminology based around phonetics. Like many things in computing, it's old, and traditional. This is, of course, based around what we call "hacker culture".</p>

<p>Please, everyone, do away with this. Use real world examples, and people bask in the immediate understanding of <b>life</b> connections. Stop being a hacker cultist by putting tradition over understanding!</p>
