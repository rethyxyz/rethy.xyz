        <b>DO NOT FALL FOR THESE GARBAGE SCAM/MONEY WASTING PROGRAMS</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>A quick explanation</b>: A "gaming" VPN will only be useful if your
        network traffic is already being blocked/filtered inside of your LAN.
        In this case, the "gaming" VPN will allow you to encrypt your network
        traffic and in turn bypass any form of packet blocking/filtering taking
        place on your network. In this case, it would allow you to run at the
        fully uncapped potential of the network.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>The problem</b>: Very rarely will any home networks contain packet
        blocking/filtering natively (if it does, you'd probably already know as
        you would have set it up yourself), but it's typical for a
        corporate/university network to. Even if this is the case, the speed
        will be totally dependent on the weakest link of the network. If your
        data is passing through any slow router/switch, all of your data will
        be bottleneck'd to the capacity of that device. These gaming VPN
        companies do not explain to the technologically illiterate in hopes
        that they'll buy it nonetheless. Therefore, you will not magically
        conjure up an increase in network speed out of thin air by using one of
        these services.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>TLDR</b>: "Gaming" VPNs won't do anything on your home network,
        unless your network traffic is <b>already</b> being filtered (it
        probably isn't). In the case that it is, though, just buy a normal,
        uncapped, non-gaming oriented VPN, as they're cheaper.
