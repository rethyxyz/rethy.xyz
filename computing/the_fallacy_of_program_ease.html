        Computer people know the notion that some of us want something that
        "just werkz". Usually this refers to either an operating system like
        Windows or Mac OS, or a program like VSCode or an App Store. This is a
        false notion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Take Windows as an example: Windows is easy to jump into. You don't
        need preparation, or knowledge about its internals. It's easy,
        understandable, simplistic, flat in aesthetic, and thematically similar
        to real life objects, allowing you to understand things at face value.
        It isn't weird text like those Unix systems... You can immediately
        understand what is happening on the screen if you spend time reading
        whatever is presented to you.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is great at the start. You can easily start working right away. No
        time spent on optimization. It's plug and play, so to speak. Download
        your IDE of choice and get at 'er.
      </p>

      <p>
        This "just werkz" mentality is coated in diminishing returns. It's a
        trade off. You're trading initial setup time for future production
        speed/the time spent working on something. You are at the will of the
        software manufacturers to make something that makes the most sense to
        you, though it never will, as they need to appeal to the lowest common
        denominator. Your Windows system is made for illiterate babies, and
        technologically illiterate Grandmas, as they are the lowest common
        denominator...
      </p>

      <p>
        If you install something from scratch, something that's truly simple in
        operation (such as *nix + a window manager (WM)), and understand how to
        use it, something that's meant to be fast, not dumbed down for the
        masses: You will work faster, and effectively, in the long run. You
        will not lose time, as you're trading your time to learn it now, for
        less time wasted later.
      </p>

        Look at programmers nowadays: Mac OS is commonly used. This seems to be
        the dominating OS among FANG types. Very many of them spend time
        writing code in bloated IDEs that have insane, ungodly keybindings
        completely without mnemonic, making it hard to build up muscle memory
        or guess what it may be without documentation. They use these programs
        as it's easy to jump into. You have a side bar with big labeled boxes
        like Project, Addons, Word Search, etc. There's a thick menu bar on top
        with everything you would (n)ever need that you can click on or attempt
        to invoke using <b>Ctrl+k</b> + <b>v</b> or some other weird key combo
        shit like that. An issue, is clicking stuff will never equal a good
        workflow. You're never committing it in your memory as you would with
        physical keyboard based bindings. If you spend real time learning an
        effective tool (like vim), you will save an astonishing amount of time
        in the future.

        Look at this airplane dashboard. Do you see a screen with a mouse that
        has tiny, clickable boxes? No. That's because it would be inefficient.
        Buttons are permanent, fixed, and produces tactile feedback. You hit
        them, and work up muscle memory according to their location. Why should
        your computing experience be any different? How is it effective, if
        you're a programmer, to slowly be clicking things, and not developing
        upon a consistent workflow? If you buy a monitor of a different
        resolution, your mouse based workflow changes drastically. The
        locations of things are different, and you're going to be slow again.

        Here's a real world example of how hard it is to learn computers when
        you put in the effort: My brother. Starting last month, he decided to
        start learning Linux with no prior experience. He decided on buying a
        used ThinkPad X220 (at around $180 CAD), and jump in right away. He
        said that he wanted to understand effective computing, as it obviously
        would be something important going into the future, and a good skill to
        have in general (all learning is good learning!). Him, being a recent
        college graduate from a Forestry-related program, had not long ago been
        introduced to the wonders of effective technological appliance through
        Excel formulas. He was able to process vast amounts of data from
        specific mathematical formulas, and in short time. He could see that
        doing this by hand instead would be ridiculous and redundant.  As he
        knew from our conversations, that I was a proponent of the wonders of
        plain text data processing, not using proprietary file formats for
        backwards compatibility, and pro typesetting compilers (LaTeX and
        groff/troff). He was able to see the potential too.
      </p>

      <p>
        Getting back to the point... He got his computer after a few weeks of
        transit, and I aided him in installing Arch Linux. You may think this
        is a dumb idea, as Arch is notorious for being a "hard" distro, mainly
        because of its lack of installer, but I don't think that's right. You
        should learn the hard way immediately than have to undo even more
        computer usage sins, such as hackjobs, and software trickery conducted
        by WYSIWYG software. After the install, he was set. I installed my
        build of dwm, and taught him the basics of window movement, spawning,
        workspaces, pacman, etc. I demonstrated dmenu usage, terminal spawning,
        and command execution. Finally, I told him to learn vim tutor, and to
        watch Luke Smith's Bash tutorials (and anything else by Smith that he
        found interesting (no information is bad information when you're
        learning computing!)). Of course, he ran into a few snags that he said
        he spent hours on, but because he was able to come to me when really
        stuck in a hole, I was able to show him the fix. Things for him started
        to click after a few days of use, and he really was able to understand
        it all after a week.  One week. That's it. The most important part of
        Linux is using your browser.  If you have an error, search it up.
        Someone is bound to have ran into the same error as you at some point
        in time. It isn't the operating system that's difficult, it's
        unlearning the years of fake computing that's difficult.

        Stop making shortcuts in your (computer) life, and go right to the
        source!  Understand what you're doing. Don't be at the will of these
        babymode software manufacturers. Develop your workflow, and benefit
        from the speed and increased productivity in the future.
