			<h1>Why Ricing Isn't a Waste of Time</h1>

			<p>Ricer: A <a href="../literature/term_definitions.php">pejorative</a> with origins in 90s car culture. Someone who overly customizes a shitty car. Historically, the cars were limited to Asian companies, hence <i>rice</i> in <i>ricer</i>.</p>

			<p>Ricer, in a computer sense, means someone who heavily customizes a computer software's look, theme (traditionally on a Unix-based operating system), or functionality. When used in this sense, it's positive, not limited to or necessarily meaning over-customization or a useless one.</p>

			<p>Ricing allows you to understand the inter-workings of the very software that you use on a daily basis. You start to discover each corner and crevice it has for the first time, which creates a sort of healthy ambition. This is the start. It's the budding process, the birth, of someone who enjoys computers. At least, it is for some people. For me it was fixing Malware ridden Dell trash-tops during the Windows XP era previously owned by a few family members before finally getting around to me.</p>

			<p>My point is, ricing is not a waste of time. You're spending quality time learning an operating system, a program, or whatever it may be. It's probably one of the least useless past times you can have, you're actually learning when you do it, and get results applicable to your daily life.</p>

			<p>Also, if you play video games, don't be a fool by dismissing ricing as a <i>"waste of time"</i>. Not because video games are bad, but because it's hypocritical, especially because ricing actually serves a purpose other than being a pass time/hobby.</p> <hr>
