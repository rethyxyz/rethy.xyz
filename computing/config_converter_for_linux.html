      <p><b><small>Created: 2020-12-20 | Modified: <?php $filename = basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']); echo date ("Y-m-d", filemtime($filename)); ?></small></b></p> <hr>

      <p>I recently wrote a Python script to convert my dotfiles between desktop and laptop format:</p>

      <p>The folder structure is the same between both devices, with the only variance being that my laptop has a secondary drive mounted at ~/1TBDrive and my desktop has four secondary drives mounted under 500GigDrive0, 500GigDrive1, and so on. This meant that I only needed to replace each instance matching 1TBDrive or 500GigDrive0, 1... and set it to whatever. All I wrote was a simple find and replace function and gave it a find and replace variable. I could have done it in Bash, but I didn't, because not, if I need to, I can take the find and replace function from my script and create a better version of <code>sed</code>.</p>

      <p><a href="https://github.com/rethyxyz/Scripts/blob/master/convert_configs_for_device.py">You can find the script here</a> if it's something that could benefit you.</p>

      <p>I wrote it in 10 minutes, so it probably isn't perfect.</p> <hr>
