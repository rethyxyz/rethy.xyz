			<p><b>DO NOT FALL FOR THESE GARBAGE SCAM/MONEY WASTING PROGRAMS</b></p>

			<p><b>A quick explanation</b>: A "gaming" VPN will only be useful if your network traffic is already being blocked/filtered inside of your LAN. In this case, the "gaming" VPN will allow you to encrypt your network traffic and in turn bypass any form of packet blocking/filtering taking place on your network. In this case, it would allow you to run at the fully uncapped potential of the network.</p>

			<p><b>The problem</b>: Very rarely will any home networks contain packet blocking/filtering natively (if it does, you'd probably already know as you would have set it up yourself), but it's typical for a corporate/university network to. Even if this is the case, the speed will be totally dependent on the weakest link of the network. If your data is passing through any slow router/switch, all of your data will be bottleneck'd to the capacity of that device. These gaming VPN companies do not explain to the technologically illiterate in hopes that they'll buy it nonetheless. Therefore, you will not magically conjure up an increase in network speed out of thin air by using one of these services.</p>

			<p><b>TLDR</b>: "Gaming" VPNs won't do anything on your home network, unless your network traffic is <b>already</b> being filtered (it probably isn't). In the case that it is, though, just buy a normal, uncapped, non-gaming oriented VPN, as they're cheaper.</p>
