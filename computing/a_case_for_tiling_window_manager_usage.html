      <h1>A Case <i>for</i> Tiling Window Manager Usage</h1>

      <p><small><b>Created: 2021-01-23 | Modified: 2021-07-15</b></small></p> <hr>

      <p>I've been hearing more and more arguments against tiling window manager usage. Specifically, I've been hearing about disliking TWM usage based on the requirement of having to configure things yourself. To them, it's <i>"a waste of time"</i>. They'd rather run something that immediately takes care of configuration for them.</p>

      <p>This narrative has been popping up on sites like /g/ (if you don't know, you won't know), lainchan, forums, etc. I'll be debunk Xah Lee's "Why Tiling Window Manager Sucks" article, as well as some of the typical arguments brought up when speaking against TWMs...</p> <br>

      <h2>Typical Statements/Questions</h2>
      <h3>"Linux is only free if you don't value your time."</h3>
      <p>People spew this when to quickly dismiss TWMs, using Linux, or anything to do with learning "difficult" computing. They say, "My time is much too valuable to learn something useless like that!", "Linux is only free if you don't value your time!", "It's a timesink", "I'd rather actually get stuff done by using Windows", or "I have no desire to learn low level programming, Python just works!". Those using these arguments always have an superiority/inferiority complex. If they admit to themselves there is a better way to do what they're doing, and they didn't know it to begin with, it's like admitting they're dumb for not knowing it. This is a bad mindset, and why you see such opinionated people on forums/imageboards such as /g/ or r*ddit who religiously object the usage of <i><b>x</b></i> but are die-hard fans/evangelists of <i><b>y</b></i>. Of course, if they just prefer to use something other than a TWM without being ignorant to how they work, that's perfectly valid, as it is just a matter of perference at the end of the day.</p>

      <p>These people have a tendency to repeat this without ever having used any TWM. Don't forget, as the saying goes, don't knock it till you (really) try it!</p>

      <p>In addition, using Linux/TWMs is a fantastic way to learn how computers work (at least how traditional operation works). It's important if you are or would like to work in the computing/IT industry, no matter where. Though you could get away with only knowing Windows/Mac OS X, it's not something I'd to risk. By using Linux, you can do whatever you want with YOUR computer. You just don't have the same freedoms while using closed source software, but I'm leaving the point.</p> <br>

      <h2>Debunking Xah Lee's "<a href="http://xahlee.info/linux/why_tiling_window_manager_sucks.php">Why Tiling Window Manager Sucks</a>" Article</h2>
      <h3>Xah's Sites</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://xahlee.info/">http://xahlee.info/</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/xahlee">https://www.youtube.com/c/xahlee</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Quick Preface</h3>
      <p>
        I'd like to recognize the fact that Xah Lee is a genius. He's someone
        who contributed his life to the world of modern day computing and
        mathematics, and should be recognized as such.
      </p>

      <p>That being said, I believe that his understanding (or rather, misunderstanding) of TWMs is: Grossly miscalculated, and comes from a point of view of ignorance and negative bias on the subject (to put it nicely, <a href="http://xahlee.info/UnixResource_dir/freebooks.html">Xah has a massive hatred of all things Unix</a>, and rightfully so).</p>

      <p>
        In-case you don't know, his article generally sweeps together all TWMs,
        and then bashes them. If you are a TWM consumer, like myself, or
        someone who has tried most of the big ones, you'll be able to see the
        gaps in his understanding, and that he hasn't used any. He make up for
        his feeble arguments using ad-homs, which are sort of humorous.
      </p>

      <p>
        Be aware: Some of his article content has spelling mistakes. I keep his
        message intact by mostly not fixing them, though they're minuscule.
      </p>

      <h3>Debunking</h3>
      <blockquote>
        "tried xmonad today for real. Currently, 1 hour into it. Tiling windows
        is unusable and inefficient."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        I'll refer back to the "Linux is only free if you don't value your
        time" section: To claim "tiling window managers are unusable and
        inefficient", after only having used one for "1 hour", is far from
        giving something a chance... This is really important when using tiling
        window managers. It's going to be really hard to build up the muscle
        memory required in only one hour of use, which is why it's bad to write
        them off so quickly. None of the ultra-speed will come in the first
        hour.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "Complete esoteric set of keys you need to memorize just for the
        tiling-window mechanism. Also, standard keys such as Alt+F4 are now
        screwed."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        He says standard, but these are the Windows standard. Anyway, you can
        implement Alt+F4 to kill a window in approximately 30 seconds, if not
        less, on <b>any</b> TWM. Therefore, it isn't a <i>"problem"</i>. Add it
        yourself. That's the point of TWMs: They're extensible, and are made to
        be configured the way <b>YOU</b> want it, not the way <b>THEY</b> want
        it. They're made to be configured by the user.
      </p>

      <p>
        I should add, the defaults take two hours to memorize, and one week to
        master and get the required muscle memory, which isn't long.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "More Combo keys = RSI. I type more than any Haskell coder on this
        earth."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Combo keys/chords won't cause RSI if you use them effectively. Chords
        be maxed at two keys at a time. If you do, press one key per hand,
        effectively breaking the chord back down to single keys (left hand for
        modifier key, right for alphabet/whatever key). If you do this, which
        is the proper way, it's not strenuous like a one-handed chord. If you
        have a ergonomic keyboard - like myself - where each side is far from
        the other, use the Windows key on the other side.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I said, you don't have to use combo keys/chords. You can create a
        single key system yourself.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "Encroach on each app's keys. This means, you'll spend time to config
        each app, or diddle with the global mod key setting. This means hours
        to be spent down the road."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        I think he's saying that by using the Alt key as modifier, you'll end
        up having conflicts with some programs (explicitly Emacs, in his case).
        True, but easily mitigated: Change the $MOD (modifier) variable from
        Alt to the Windows key. <b>NO</b> programs use the Windows key on Linux
        (probably), therefore, no conflicts. I'm not sure why he says
        <i>"changing the mod key will take hours"</i> when that's blatantly
        false. It's seconds to change something in the configuration file let
        alone the <b>global modifier variable</b>... I believe he outted
        himself through saying that.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "Completely screwing emacs's keys. (No, remapping to any of Super,
        Hyper, Menu, CapsLock keys won't help. All modifier keys are used up in
        my emacs for many purposes, including inserting math symbols.)"
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        As I said, remap MODifier key to the Windows key. As I know, Emacs
        doesn't use the Windows key (by default).
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "If all you do is text terminals, that's ok. But as soon as you have
        browser, image viewer, image editor, text/voice/video chat programs,
        math/scientific apps, â€¦, each really needs its own optimal
        position/size."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Fair point. Tiling window managers are optimal with a terminal based
        workflow. It's why I use TUI/command-line programs. They cut down on
        <i>"bloat"</i>, and are more extensible than the average GUI.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "One symptom of tiling windows inefficiency is the so-called fibonacci
        layout."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        No one uses this. I can only speak for myself, but I believe the
        general consensus is it's mostly decorative. As he said, the windows
        (frames) created end up being too small.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "Suboptimal window size problem when windows are forced into a table
        layout. Notice the squashed clock, and wrapped lines in terminal.
        [image source http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fibonacci]"
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The claim that <i>"(There are) suboptimal window size problem when
        windows are forced into a table layout"</i> is out of ignorance. He
        wouldn't have said it if he had known  how dwm functioned. This is
        clearly shown by "tried xmonad today for real. Currently, 1 hour into
        it. Tiling windows is unusable and inefficient". dwm uses a
        primary/secondary layout, meaning one half of the screen is the primary
        window - in this case being the browser - and the rest is for the
        secondary windows.
      </p>

      </p><br>

      <p>
        This is when he devolves into ad-homs, and making unchallengible
        claims. One of them: <i>"(but in fact, Microsoft Windows have a key
        sequence system starting with Alt key, that is actually the most
        efficient system for keybinding"</i>. Hard to refute. Not sure where he
        got this evidence, but it probably isn't based on concrete fact.
      </p>

      <h3>My Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        By breaking down each of his points against TWMs, I conclude he isn't
        saying a whole lot. What he does prove, is he has one hour worth of TWM
        knowledge.
