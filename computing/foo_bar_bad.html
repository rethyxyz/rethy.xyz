      <h1>Foo Bar Bad</h1>

        Have you ever learned something from a good example effortlessly, other
        times getting literally nothing from another? Have you ever noticed the
        latter seems to be the <b>foo</b> <b>bar</b> example? This is the world
        of bad examples. This is something especially prevalent in computing
        sectors, and I'll say why.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the worst. Nothing is grasped from this. What these examples should be, are things to make real world connections, not this <b>foo</b>, <b>bar</b>, <b>baz</b>, unintelligible mess.
      </p>

      <p>
        The reason we started doing this, was because it's something invoked
        from old MIT terminology based around military phonetics. Like many
        things in computing, it's old, and traditional. This is, of course,
        based around what we call "hacker culture".
      </p>

      <p>
        Please, everyone, do away with this. Use real world examples, and bask
        in the immediate understanding of real <b>life</b> connections. Stop
        being a hacker cultist by putting tradition over understanding.
