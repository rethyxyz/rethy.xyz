<h1>Comfy/Offline Proof Windows (7)</h1>
<p><b><small>Created: 2021-04-28 | Modified: <?php $filename = basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']); echo date ("Y-m-d", filemtime($filename)); ?></small></b></p> <hr>

<p><b>Why would I want to do this?</b> Do you enjoy the soulless feel of modern day Windows/computing? Do you enjoy not owning your music, movies, videos, and games? Do you enjoy DRM? Do you want to continue to lose your long history of YouTube and Spotify playlists because Google, Spotify, and Netflix removes them seemingly for no reason? I, myself, enjoy "possessing" each individual file of the things I enjoy, such as albums, movies, TV shows, etc. This allows me to share as I wish, move as I wish, watch as I wish (no more Spotify premium license), and most importantly: Do as I wish. No one will be able to spy on you, or see your listening/viewing habits. You can truly be alone doing whatever it may be.</p>

<p><b>Windows 7 support is over. Isn't it unsafe?</b> Public support is over, Enterprise support isn't. No new features are being released, but security patches are still being made on a near daily basis.</p>

<a href="making_windows_7_usable_in_2021.php">I have an article showing how to spoof Enterprise updates</a>. I skimmed through the BypassESU script, and I can almost completly guarantee it doesn't invoke anything exterior that could be seen as sketchy. I still can't guarantee it's 100% safe, though, so use at your own risk.</p>

<p>To me, true comfy is being able to go offline and still keep total functionality. Therefore, everything in this list is made to work 1:1 the same offline. As you may know, freedom of choice is the biggest part of freedom, and sometime you may want to disappear for a bit.</p>

<p>Keep in mind this article is super broad and fragmented as it's mostly opinion based.</p>

<h2>Updates (Important first step)</h2>
<p>Malware is not comfy, and neither are security vulnerabilities. <a href="making_windows_7_usable_in_2021.php">Follow this article to install Windows first and beforehand</a>. After, come back here when fully updated.</p>

<h2>Anti-virus</h2>
<p><a href="">I have an article talking about ClamAV</a>. You can learn about it there. All you need to know, is it's the lightest, and doesn't have realtime none sense. My recommendation is to set it up, and to set it to scan twice daily.</p>

<!--

<p>Simply run</p>

<p><code></code></p>

<p>from a cmd prompt window with admin privileges to schedule the task.</p>

-->

<h2>Performance tweaks</h2>
<h3>Visual set to only</h3>
<p>Open Control Panel. Navigate to System/Advanced system settings/Performance Settings.</p>

<p><center><img src="files\performance_options_win7.PNG"></center></p>
<p>Change to match attached image. All else is unneeded (note, I use a classic theme derivative, so my Performance Options may be different from yours if Windows Aero is enabled).</p>

<h3>Turn off windows sounds</h3>
<p><center><img src="files\sound_win7.PNG"></center></p>
<p>Windows sounds are loud and break immersion. Turn them off, as they're unneeded.</p>

<h3>Ease of access</h3>
<p>Super underrated setting. I rarely see people use "<i>Raise when mouse hover</i>". Also turn off <i>window snapping</i> while you're at it, but it's just preference. It's more precise without.</p>

<h3>Improved folder options</h3>
<p><center><img src="files\folder_options_win7.PNG"></center></p>
<p><i>Single-click to open an item (point to select)</i> and <i>Underline icon titles consistent with my browser</i> is the most important part. Way easier and more efficient than double clicking each time. This is the way traditional Unix file managers function by default.</p>

<p><center><img src="files\folder_options_view_win7.PNG"></center></p>
<p><center><img src="files\folder_options_view_2_win7.PNG"></center></p>
<p>Match accordingly.</p>

<h3>Disable services</h3>
<p>I wouldn't call Windows 7 bloated, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't strive for a thinner, snappier system. You don't need excess. It's good to trim the fat where possible.<p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><code>sc config WSearch start= disabled</code></li>
<li><code>sc config Spooler start= disabled</code></li>
<li><code>sc config UxSms start= disabled</code></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>You may not want to disable WSearch as it correlates with Windows Search. Personally, I choose to disable it.</p>

<h3>Removing <i>Windows features</i></h3>
<p>There are lots of excess programs you won't need after setup (Windows Media Player, Tablet Mode, Internet Explorer, XPS viewer...). I remove these features outright. No reason to have them when you have better alternatives (Firefox, foobar2000, VLC media player, etc.).</p>

<ul>
<li><code>DISM /online /disable-feature /NoRestart /featurename:FaxServicesClientPackage</code></li>
<li><code>DISM /online /disable-feature /NoRestart /featurename:Internet-Explorer-Optional-amd64</code></li>
<li><code>DISM /online /disable-feature /NoRestart /featurename:MSRDC-Infrastructure</code></li>
<li><code>DISM /online /disable-feature /NoRestart /featurename:MediaCenter</code></li>
<li><code>DISM /online /disable-feature /NoRestart /featurename:MediaPlayback</code></li>
<li><code>DISM /online /disable-feature /NoRestart /featurename:OpticalMediaDisc</code></li>
<li><code>DISM /online /disable-feature /NoRestart /featurename:Printing-Foundation-Features</code></li>
<li><code>DISM /online /disable-feature /NoRestart /featurename:Printing-Foundation-InternetPrinting-Client</code></li>
<li><code>DISM /online /disable-feature /NoRestart /featurename:Printing-XPSServices-Features</code></li>
<li><code>DISM /online /disable-feature /NoRestart /featurename:SearchEngine-Client-Package</code></li>
<li><code>DISM /online /disable-feature /NoRestart /featurename:TabletPCOC</code></li>
<li><code>DISM /online /disable-feature /NoRestart /featurename:WindowsGadgetPlatform</code></li>
<li><code>DISM /online /disable-feature /NoRestart /featurename:WindowsMediaPlayer</code></li>
<li><code>DISM /online /disable-feature /NoRestart /featurename:Xps-Foundation-Xps-Viewer</code></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><center><img src="files\features_tab.PNG"></center></p>
<p>Your Features tab will look like this after. You may not want to turn off Windows Search.</p>

<h3>Turn off mouse accel</h3>
<p><center><img src="files/mouse_accel.PNG"></center></p>
<p>Un-check <i>Enhance pointer precision</i>. It does the opposite of what it says it will. Turning it off will make your mouse movement consistent, allowing you to build up muscle memory accordingly.</p>

<h3>Change keyboard repeat rate</h3>
<p><center><img src="files/keyboard_repeat_rate.PNG"></center></p>
<p>Change <i>Repeat delay</i> to <i>Short</i>. This is mega important for me. Without this, text editing is an impossibly slow task. Especially if you use speedy vim.</p>

<h2>Theming</h2>
<h3>Create a Windows Theme</h3>
<p>Windows 7 has a functional theming manager (unlike Windows 10). On Windows 7, you're allowed to customize your system. You might as well take advantage of it. A good theme plays a huge part in the overall comfy experience. Spend time developing a theme that feels good for you. Change font, color, size, etc. It's your PC, so make it your own.</p>

<p><center><img src="files/win_7_theme.PNG"></center></p>

<p><a href="files/rethyxyz_win7.themepack">Mine is a modified version of the classic theme.</a>. Ignore the redd*t aliens in the background. I've been using the wallpaper for a long time, and like it only for the green mushroom. And no, I have never used redd*t.</p>

<h3>Change your profile picture</h3>
<p><center><img src="files/profile_win7.PNG"></center></p>
<p>Change the default profile image unless you really enjoy it (you shouldn't, it's devoid of emotion). Even if you feel indifferent, change it anyways. It feels too impersonal without it.</p>

<h3>Change your cursor</h3>
<p><center><img src="files/dino.cur"></center></p>
<p>There are way better cursors than the Windows default. For years on Windows, I have used <a href="files/dino.cur">Reckful's (R.I.P.) dinosaur cursor</a>. It's my preferred cursor.</p>

<h2>Data hoarding</h2>
<h3>Games</h3>
<p>I rarely play games, though I have them downloaded in-case a situation arises where it would be appropriate to. If you're offline, you're going to want to have a library of non-DRM games to choose from. You'll have options. You may not play them often, but you never know when you'll have a fuck load of downtime and want to waste a huge chunk.</p>

<p>I get my games from a <b>pirate at a bay</b> (if you get what I mean). If you download only from <b>verified</b> and <b>trusted</b> uploaders, you'll be safe. <a href="clamav_the_only_non_shit_antivirus.php">You should scan everything you download as well</a>, but be careful for false positives.</p>

<p>
<b>Games types to gather:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Prioritize a bunch of small ones vs one big one</b>: Small ones = more variety, and less space taken. You can get more hours across multiple games vs a single one which is likely to run out of content quicker than a bunch will.</li>
<li><b>SCUMMVM</b>: Not only are these games of a small size, they are deep in story, and most have not played them. In addition, they are not brainrot as they have an end to them, nor do they <i>"hold your hand"</i>, which will ensure you think for yourself.</li>
<li><b>Arcade games</b>: Peggle, Chicken Invaders, etc. Small games that you can jump into, play a single game, or play for a while. <i>Be aware, though, these are by definition a waste of time</i>.</li>
<li><b>Visual novels</b>: Same idea as SCUMMVM games: Small in size, big in story. You'll want variety to keep your brain stimulated. These are the most integral games to my setup. If you're not into weeb shit, I'm sure there exists a sutable novel without that content type.</li>
<li><b>GOG</b> (good old games): These games are DRM free, and there are a lot of games like this listed from <b>the pirate at the bay</b>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Personal game recommendations:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Angel Beats!: -1st Beat-</b></li>
<li><b>Chicken Invaders 3</b></li>
<li><b>Samorost 1 & 2</b> (I haven't played the 3rd game)</li>
<li><b>Peggle</b></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Books</h3>
<p>I manage my books in <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: Download books in <code>epub</code> format. <code>epub</code> is just next, and is therefore more manipulatable.</p>

<p>I get my <b>copyright free</b> books from <a href="http://libgen.rs/">http://libgen.rs/</a>.</p>

<p>
<b>Comfy books:</b>
<ul>
<li>Anything by Haruki Murakami, but Norwegian Wood or Kafka on the Shore especially</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Music</h3>
<p><center><img src="files/music_win7.PNG"></center></p>
<p>For years I've been hoarding music in 320 KBPS MP3 and FLAC formats. I've got 200GBs of straight music. If you have the space, it's nice to have the option to listen to a whole plethora of music. Hoard music instead of getting it from Spotify. I get my "<b>royalty free</b>" music from <b>Soulseek</b>.</p>

<p><b>Tagging</b>:</p>
<p>Often overlooked. If you are collecting a bunch of music, you're going to want pristine metadata. Use <b>MusicBrainz Picard</b>. Simply choose the folder you want to scan (such as soulseek complete downloads folder), and hit save, which will move the newly tagged files into their designated directory structure. You can find a tutorial somewhere on their website, you can figure it out for yourself. It isn't difficult.</p>

<p><b>foobar2000</b>:</p>
<p><center><a href="files/foobar2000_windows_7.PNG"><img src="files/foobar2000_windows_7.PNG"></a></center></p>

<p>foobar2000 is the best music player on Windows. It's the most powerful and extensible on Windows. It supports every audio codex you'd use. As you can see above, you can do a lot with it. There's a whole list of addons one the foobar2000 website too. I'm using waveform seekbar, lyrics, and facets addons.</p>

<p>
<b>Comfy album recommendations:</b>
<ul>
<li>Elements of Life - Tiesto</li>
<li>Four Post Cards - Hiroshi Yoshimura</li>
<li>Hydroponic Garden - Carbon Based Lifeforms</li>
<li>Souvlaki - Slowdive</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Comics</h3>
<p>Like I said in the book category, you should use Calibre. <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/291916/how-to-view-cbr-and-cbz-comic-books-in-calibre/">To be able to read comics in it, you need to enable cbr and cbz</a>.</p>

<p>I get my <b>copyright free</b> comics from <a href="https://getcomics.info">https://getcomics.info</a>.</p>

<p>
<b>Comfy comic recommendations</b>:
<ul>
<li>Seconds</li>
<li>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</li>
<li>Kick-Ass</li>
</ul>
Sorry, I'm just not into that super hero shit (Shadowhawk and Hell-Boy are pretty good though), but have read my fair share of comics in the past.
</p>

<h3>Visual media</h3>
<p>Visual media is a blanket term for movies, series, anime, YouTube videos, whatever. I get my games from a <b>pirate at a bay</b> (if you get what I mean). Just make sure to download only from <i>verified</i> or <i>trusted</i> uploaders.</p>

<p><b>Organization</b>:</p>
<p><center><img src="files/visual_media_win7.PNG"></center></p>

<p>Optimal categorical organization.</p>

<p><center><img src="files/visual_media_file_win7.PNG"></center></p>

<p>Files should look like this. <b>Format:</b> <i>Release year</i> - <i>Film/Show name</i> - <i>Resolution</i></p>

<p><b>Viewing:</b></p>
<p>Viewing takes place in VLC media player. It works, and has the most features (90% are useless). I use it over mpv in-case I need a special feature someday.</p>

<p>
    <b>Comfy movies recommendations</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Amelie</li>
        <li>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</li>

</ul>
</p>

<h2>Downloading programs</h2>
<p>You might as well download every single useful program you can think of. You never know when you'll need em. I'll name the ones I install:</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>7-Zip</li>

<li>VeraCrypt</li>
<li>gVim</li>
<li>qBittorrent</li>
<li>youtube-dl</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Backups</h2>
<p>Finally, backups. Data loss isn't comfy. Backup your files weekly (or at whatever other frequency) to ensure you don't lose your stuff. All you need, is another device which holds the duplicated version of your beloved files.</p>

<p>If you don't have a lot of space, like myself (I have four 500GB Drives, one of which is for backups), I prioritize backing up all documents, Music, YouTube videos, and User folders. I choose not to backup any movies or series (aside from a few rare shows) because they are: Too big, and easier to find than high-quality albums.</p>
