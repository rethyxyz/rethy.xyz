      <h1>Bad Openbox Configuration</h1>
      <p><b><small>Created: 2021-03-13 | Modified: <?php $filename = basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']); echo date ("Y-m-d", filemtime($filename)); ?></small></b></p><hr>

      <p>I haven't touched Openbox in eight years or so. Back when I started using Linux, it was the first WM (Window Manger) I really got deep into, starting from my first use of Crunchbang, a now defunct Debian-based distribution. I mained this back in the day. It was pretty good at the time, and still is. It was a WM that (en)forced a sleek minimal design while keeping the full functionality of a DE (Desktop Environment).</p>

      <p>I like the bare simplicity of Openbox, being only a way to manager windows. If you want a status bar, implement it (or write it) yourself! Very true to the Unix philosophy.</p>

      <p>Something I didn't remember, was the rc.xml configuration file. This is because I never had to configure it back in the day. Now, of course, I need to configure things to my linking. I bend the program's functionality, not the other way around. An XML file for configuration is bad. Really bad. It's hard to figure-things-out without reading the documentation beforehand. I don't know why they didn't make their own configuration file layout, like i3wm. The i3wm configuration scheme is way better, as you can discern the proper syntax immediately.</p>

      <p>Openbox has only one good configuration tool that I know of called <a href="https://github.com/bajaco/hotbox">hotbox</a>. It's actually really good. Here's how you use it:</p> <br>

        <b><small>XML is bad for configuration organization. This is an unintelligible mess, and too tedious to modify by hand.</small></b>
      </center>
      </p> <br>

      <p>I think Openbox is dead, but I may be wrong. I do know that Openbox is unfortunately definitely dead by itself. I feel this is partly because of the bad configuration setup.</p>
