      <h1>A Critique of WSL</h1>

        I started messing around with WSL v2 on the newest Windows 10 version.
        The move, was to recreate my Arch Linux terminal environment inside. I
        easily converted my scripts to work with Windows using a single
        $WIN_HOME variable holding my Windows home directory. This was placed
        in my ~/.bash_profile. That worked fine. I installed vim and vim-plug
        alongside my <code>.vimrc</code>. I used Windows Terminal in unison
        with vim. That worked fine. The latency was bearable, unlike
        PowerShell. I started running the scripts. That worked fine, but I
        quickly noticed the heavy WSL performance hit occurring while running
        these simple Bash and Python scripts...

        The script first up was my recipe scraper for a website I'm working on.
        It's called <a href="https://ezrecipe.xyz">ezrecipe.xyz</a>, and is
        meant to be the biggest recipe repository in the world. Ambitious, I
        know, seeing as it isn't even complete yet. But, it's not as difficult
        as you may think, thanks to the script. I was going to write it in
        POSIX Shell, but thanks to the recipe-scrapers module created by
        hhursev, I didn't have to write any XML or JS parsers. I could import
        the modules and go. That's what I did. All that was needed, was to
        automate the scraping by having it go through a list of websites fed to
        the script through an internal list. Thankfully, the creator put a list
        of website that the module supports by default, so they were easy to
        find. This made my job really easy. I copied the websites that held
        recipe IDs in their URLs, and made the script increment it until, say,
        500000 or so. After it hits that number, the while loop breaks, and the
        next URL is taken in as the new incremented website. The number is set
        to 0, and the scraper goes on... 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on until 500000 is
        achieved again.

        The issue came about on Windows. On Linux: No issues. The script did
        what it was supposed to, and ran at a normal speed, mostly being
        dependent on my web connection, as the script does nothing hardware
        intensive. On Windows, though, it was a whole different story. It was
        around 10 times slower than on Linux, and pruned by apparent hardware
        performance. Very odd. I searched this issue, and concluded that WSL is
        simply slow. The reason being, is it being emulated by VMware,
        Virtualbox, or Hyper-V. Either way, these are slow emulation platforms,
        and mostly explains why my software performanced the way it did.
      </p>

        This, unfortunately, is a deal breaker. It makes WSL mostly useless to
        me, as it's so slow there's no point in using it, and will make this
        process 10 times slower than on native Linux. I guess I'll have to put
        up with it until I go back to Arch, which will definitely be soon.
