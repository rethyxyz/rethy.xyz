<h1>The Fall of Linux Desktops</h1>

<p>Linux desktops will never catch on. The title is false, as they've never risen. The true meaning of the title, or what I mean to say, is I believe Linux desktops are superior to Windows (post-Windows 7), but don't agree they'll gain any mainstream traction because of the current state of modern day DEs (many WMs are good (dwm (the best), i3, openbox...) but normies won't take time to understand them).</p>

<p>GNOME desktop: A waste bin companion. People call OS X baby-mode while GNOME is the truest representation. It's shite. It's so insanely useless, and getting worse by release. Instead of developing and implementing improved features, they remove existing ones (no exaggeration). It's like an iPad OS on a desktop, but one that has less functionality and customizability than what would be on an iPad.</p>

<p>It's bloated too. It uses one and a half gigabytes alone, nothing open. That's more than Windows 10 by default. This seems to contradict 2000s Linux evangelists, seeing as much of their pro-Linux rhetoric was based around Linux being able to run on anything (which it is, but not with GNOME running).</p>

<p>Other DEs are no better. They enforce strict rules, something made as an attempt to mimic a Windows like environment. XFCE does this, which doesn't do such a bad job. Though, it shouldn't be doing it at all.</p>

<p>I believe the actual issue inhibiting growth in the desktop OS market share is stemming from making Linux something that it can't be. Something that it shouldn't be. Current day developers try to make a Windows like environment on Linux. They're making Linux something that it isn't. It doesn't work, and creates more hack-jobs. We should be enforcing the great parts of Linux, such as it's raw, simplistic power (powerful command-line interpreters, unlike Windows), the Unix philosophy, and how it isn't Windows. Linux is not Windows, and Windows is not Linux. Lets stop trying to make them coalesce.</p>

<p>Linux won't catch on with normies because it's a different experience than Windows. I mean, look at GNOME again. It looks similar to Windows: It has over-sized buttons, a status bar system, life like icons for instant recognizability, but suffers from massive inconsistencies (<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/larger/public/field/image/2015/07/windows-10-menus_.jpg">just like Windows 10</a>). GNOME has a lot of weird shit randomly thrown in a desktop, like hot corners (why?). When a normie tries GNOME, they don't see it as "cool" or "innovative", they see it as a cheap Windows knockoff, which is what it is. I mean, why use that shit when you can use Windows, the genuine version over the fake?</p>

<p>The solution? Stop using/supporting GNOME and other bad DEs/WMs. They enforce false ideas surrounding how Linux operates. Instead of changing the pure beauty of Linux, embrace it. Show outsiders the things you can do on Linux that you can't do on Windows, and how they work differently. Let them know the process is different, but the outcome is the same.</p> <hr>
