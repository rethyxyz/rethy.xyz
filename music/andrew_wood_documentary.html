        I recently watched a documentary about Andrew Wood, a pioneer of the
        original grunge scene in Seattle, Washington.
      </p>

      <p>
        The documentary focused on his life specifically, but also included
        information on his first band, Malfunkshun, and his second, Mother Love
        Bone, being more well known. The latter is known as arguably the first
        breakout band of what is now known as the grunge scene, albeit short
        lived. Almost all other original grunge bands (Nirvana, Soundgarden
        (whom the lead singer, Chris Cornell, lived with Wood), Mudhoney, The
        Melvins) have been inspired or influenced by either or both of their
        bands.
      </p>

      <p>
        The documentary focused in Wood's personality, being proclaimed as
        "quite the character". During the time in his first band, Malfunkshun,
        he commonly dressed up in flashy female garb and sported makeup,
        breaking gender norms, something he was known for locally. He did away
        with this after the inception of his second band. His purpose was quite
        simply fun, nothing else, really.
      </p>

      <p>
        They also went into his many addictions and downfalls, which,
        eventually, most unfortunately, randomly, and suddenly, let to his
        death from Heroin overdose.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, I enjoyed the documentary, even though I don't think his
        second band, Mother Love Bone, was anything special, sounding like glam
        rock meets dad rock. I did enjoy the piano based songs from their first
        album, though, as I did with his first bands.

      <p>
        If you're into musical sub-cultures/sub-scenes, this is a good
        documentary to understand the proto-grunge scene with much less bias,
        dramatization, and money-seeking like ones from mainstream sources.
        This is because the doc. was primarily pursued by Wood's father.
