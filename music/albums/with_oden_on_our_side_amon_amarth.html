<p>2006. <b>With Oden on Our Side</b>. <b>Amon Amarth</b>. Their best album.</p>

<p>This album is the same idea as the others, but better in every musical sense: More themeatic (viking shit), melodically better, inventive rhythm sections, dynamic drumming (not boring metal drums), lyrically better (more viking shit), etc. The vocals are the same as <b>Deceiver of the Gods</b>, but I've always thought it was unique.</p>

<p>Less cringey. Yes, the album is pertaining to an obscure sub-culture (viking shit), but the way they go about it is heavier, and more inventive. Each song is about dying in combat, or has elements of it, which I find funny, but enjoy more on this album than the last.</p>

<p>
<b>Tracks that stand out</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>Valhall Awaits Me</b></li>
    <ul>
    <li>Okay song. It has an atypical arpeggiating guitar solo and post-chorus pieces.</li>
    </ul>
<li><b>Runes to My Memory</b></li>
    <ul>
    <li>Good guitar rhythm section. Nice post-chorus going into the second guitar rhythm section.</li>
    </ul>
<li><b>Cry of the Black Birds</b></li>
    <ul>
    <li>I belive this was the most successful song off of this album. It's really good. Atmospheric intro, nice lead riff throughout.</li>
    </ul>
<li><b>Prediction of Warfare</b></li>
    <ul>
    <li>Nice intro: super melodic lead, and really nice drumming with stero mixing on top. The main riff loses me, but it's nice when it comes back to the intro riff later.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
