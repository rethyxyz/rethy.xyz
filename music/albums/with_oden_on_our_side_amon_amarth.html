                2006. <b>With Oden on Our Side</b>. <b>Amon Amarth</b>. Their
                best album.
            </p>

            <p>
                This album is the same idea as the others, but better in every
                musical sense: More themeatic (viking shit), melodically
                better, inventive rhythm sections, dynamic drumming (not boring
                metal drums), lyrically better (more viking shit), etc. The
                vocals are the same as <b>Deceiver of the Gods</b>, but I've
                always thought it was unique.
            </p>

            <p>
                Less cringey. Yes, the album is pertaining to an obscure
                sub-culture (viking shit), but the way they go about it is
                heavier, and more inventive. Each song is about dying in
                combat, or has elements of it, which I find funny, but enjoy
                more on this album than the last.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Tracks that stand out</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Valhall Awaits Me</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Okay song. It has an atypical arpeggiating guitar
                            solo and post-chorus pieces.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><b>Runes to My Memory</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Good guitar rhythm section. Nice post-chorus going
                            into the second guitar rhythm section.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><b>Cry of the Black Birds</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I belive this was the most successful song off of
                            this album. It's really good. Atmospheric intro,
                            nice lead riff throughout.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><b>Prediction of Warfare</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Nice intro: super melodic lead, and really nice
                            drumming with stero mixing on top. The main riff
                            loses me, but it's nice when it comes back to the
                            intro riff later.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </p>
