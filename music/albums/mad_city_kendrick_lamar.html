<p>Kendrick Lamar in his prime, and, in my not-so-humble-and-massively-knowledgeable-opinion, his best album. In my opinion, this is the feel that <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i> tried to replicate. An introspective, self-aware, recount of a wide spectrum of emotions manifested into bite size hip-hop tracks.</p>

<p>
  The album is largely narrative, jumping between two broad types of self: Cocky, and modest. This is really shown on <i>Backseat Freestyle</i> and The Art of <i>Peer Pressure</i>.
  <blockquote>
    Really I'm a piece maker, but I'm with the homies right now.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    Really I'm a sober soul, but I'm with the homies right now.
  </blockquote>

  There's a lot more of this type of speak. Our personalities change situationally. We're dynamic. His reason for switching? As he says, he's with the boys. Or as he said, "with the homies". This album deals a lot with peer pressure, and youth life. The theme is so relatable because it isn't just limited to Compton, California. Peer pressure is something that all of us will have to deal with, or have dealt with, in a modern society.
