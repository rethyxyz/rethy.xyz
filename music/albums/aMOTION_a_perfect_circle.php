<p>aMOTION. 2004. An underestimated and unheard of compilation. Truly, it's a collection of remixes of the previous album (from the year 2000), Mer de noms.</p>

<p>A collection of tracks by a whole plethora of (at least to me) unheard artists (I'm probably just ignorant to them). The only reason I <b>occasionally</b> come back to this album is for <b>3 Libras (Feel My Ice dub mix)</b>. The song is a good way to test audio devices because of its heavy use of depth, stereo, and other effects. Plus, it's just a good remix.</p>
