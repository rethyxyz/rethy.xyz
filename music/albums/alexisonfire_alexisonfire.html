<p><small><center>I believe this band described the album's sound as "two Catholic girls at a school having a knife fight".</center></small></p>

<p>Alexisonfire. Self-titled album. 2002. Mid-era Post-hardcore piece thrown out of Canada, landing seemingly everywhere but the origin point (at least, at the time).</p>

<p>First heard these guys in the early 2010s. First, I heard their trending tracks around the 2010s, disliked them. Later, I heard their earlier, more cultic post-hardcore tracks from the early 2000s (thanks to /mu/), and enjoyed them. Thought I knew of them for years prior to first enjoyment, I didn't realize they were from Canada.</p>

<p>As does a lot of those late 90s - early 2000s post-hardcore albums, their S/T bases much of each track's "energy" on the chorus rather than each track's pieces individually.</p>

<p>The album in its entirety is a good display of guitar technicallity. Not in the way of innovation. It's a good take on the pre-existing framework that is the early 2000s post-hardcore genre.</p>

<p><b>The Kennedy Curse</b> has an interesting Metalcore feel, featured by that alternating low note palm mute to open high note, ascending and descending. Hard to explain, but you'll know it if you hear it.</p>

<p>Favorite song: <b>The Kennedy Curse</b></p>
