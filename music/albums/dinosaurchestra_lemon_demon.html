        A album guaranteed to be unknown to anyone living outside of the
        internet during the mid-2000s (even if you were, it's still
        unlikely).
      </p>

      <p>
        A nostalgic album from old school internet content creator Neil
        Cicierega, who has went on to create an whole assortment of music/short
        films ranging from <i>Harry Potter Puppet Pals</i> to <i>The Ultimate
        Showdown of Ultimate Destiny</i> (which is found on this album;
        track #6).
      </p>

      <p>
        He's least notably-but-still-importantly know for old school computer
        animations created from collections of GIFs and JPEGs called
        Animutations. His creations landed him on the news at the age of (I
        believe) 14, his first taste of Internet virality.
      </p>

        Structurally, the album is simple. Typical time signatures and rhythms.
        Most of the outcome is predictable, as you can expect where the next
        section will go and how it will sort of sound. This isn't a bad thing,
        as there isn't too over simplification. Now, where its inventiveness
        come in, is through its subject matter and actual instrumentation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lets take the lyrics for an example: The song <b>Stuck</b> (track 5) is
        about Neil (the creator of the album) being stuck in a song (this song,
        to be specific). It's actually quite humorous. Have a listen.
      </p>

      <p>That's just one example, but most songs have this sort of superficial-introspective-ness.</p>

      <p>Favorite song: <b>This Hyper World</b> or <b>Deep in the Ocean</b></p>
