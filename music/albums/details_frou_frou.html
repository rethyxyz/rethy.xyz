<p>A fantastical album from 2001. Imogen Heap and Guy Sigsworth. A two piece, short lived largely Britsh ensemble. Together they have only one album, being <b>Details</b>. Experimental and minimal electronica. Heavily based around vocals supported by reverberating background instrumentation to uplift, and accentuate.</p>

<p>An album lacking immediate mainstream success. Instead, it developed cult followings years after, particularly during the mid to late 2000s. I believe the project was a sort of side one, not meant to be long term, but to be more experimental, or, more specifically, non-compromising. I think their dissolution was planned, and amicable.</p>

<p>Initial cult-like groupings populated after the release of the 2004 film <i>Garden State</i> created by Zach Braff. The song <i>Let Go</i> (first track) played at films end, sparked people to seek the name of the song. Later, after greater accessibility was established, the movie became a devisor within, separating those-in-the-know prior to, being the "superior", and those in post, as the lesser ones.</p>

<p><small><center>Track is <b>I'm God</b> by <b>Clams Casino</b>. This guy actually produced many of the beats above. The song sampled is <b>Just for Now</b> (off of Speak for Yourself, 2005 (not Frou Frou)).</center></small></p>

<p>More recently, as of the early 2010s, many Hip-Hop artists had started sampling this and the lead's solo work. It became a sort of trend for a while, to sample her work. You can find a few examples in the videos above.</p>

<p><small><center>Track is <b>Whatcha Say</b> by <b>Jason Derulo</b>. The song sampled is <b>Hide And Seek</b>.</center></small></p>

<p>You can also see it in R&amp;B. The song sucks, but you can find it above. Also, this isn't a tasteful sample, as it's only used for the hook. Plus, it's nearly verbatim.</p>

<p>The only thing I really dislike about the album is the shit lyrics. Lyrics range from romantic relationship, to desire. Boring, and generic, but I'm glad it's made up for through its rich and inventive instrumentation.</p>

<p><center> Favorite song: <b>Psychobabble</b> </center></p>
