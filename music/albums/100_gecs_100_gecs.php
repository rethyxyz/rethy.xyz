<p>A semi-humorous hyperpop album. One of the first, and one of the best in class.</p>

<p>This came out in 2019, during the time I was in college. I remember people making jokes about this album, saying it was "the best", while obviously memeing. This led me to listen to this LP, which I thought was pretty good. Funny, stupid, but it has some genuinely good bits. I'll say, this isn't an album that you'd listen to while in a car with your friends.</p>

<p>This album seemed to have kickstarted Hyperpop, as I had heard none of this genre prior to 100 gecs. In post, I've heard many other hyperpop works, and have seen the amount of popularity through the dedicated Internet festivals based off of the genre alone.</p>

<p><b>hand crushed by a mallet</b> is best on album.</p>
