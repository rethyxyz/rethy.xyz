        A semi-humorous hyperpop album. One of the first, and one of the best
        in class.

        This came out in 2019, during the time I was in college. I remember
        people making jokes about this album, saying it was "the best", while
        obviously memeing. This led me to listen to this LP, which I thought
        was pretty good. Funny, stupid, but it has some genuinely good bits.
        I'll say, this isn't an album that you'd listen to while in a car with
        your friends.

        This album seemed to have kickstarted Hyperpop, as I had heard none of
        this genre prior to 100 gecs. In post, I've heard many other hyperpop
        works, and have seen the amount of popularity through the dedicated
        Internet festivals based off of the genre alone.
