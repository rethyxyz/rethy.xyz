<p>A album guaranteed to be unknown to anyone living outside of the internet during the mid-2000s (even if you were, it's still unlikely).</p>

<p>A nostalgic album from old school internet content creator Neil Cicierega, who has created an assortment of music/short films ranging from <i>Harry Potter Puppet Pals</i> to <i>The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny</i> (which is found on this album; track #6).</p>

<center><p>Favorite song: <b>This Hyper World</b> or <b>Deep in the Ocean</b></p></center>
