      <p>He Has Left Us Alone, but Shafts of Light Sometimes Grace the Corner of Our Rooms. 2000.</p>

      <p>A depressing album from multi-instrumentalist Efrim Menuck, along with many other of his typical co-colaborators. Usually, they're working together with the known post-rock band <i>Godspeed You! Black Emperor</i>.</p>

      <p>Not that you should weight two different, very purposefully distinct musical projects: I do belive that <i>A Silver Mt. Zion</i> is the better band, and unfortunately, reputationally underrated. The reason I make this distinction, knowing fully well it's "rude" in the music world, as this is why this piece of work was not release under the Godspeed You! Black Emperor name, is because I want to bring awareness to this band. It seems not many have been graced by their musicality, as I have not seen nor heard <b>anyone</b> (aside from the guitarist from Deafheaven) mention this band anywhere. Unfortunate.</p>

      <p>The song <b>For Wanda</b> features samples of crying (I believe done by Efrim himself) portraying the sadness he felt for his dog (Wanda), when it unfortunately died. I think the entire album is dedicated to his late companion, but I could be wrong.</p>

      <p><b>13 Angels Standing Guard 'Round the Side of Your Bed</b> is a nice track. It's mostly computerized, and features angelic vocal samples with small, reverberated chord chops begining around the middle. All is encompassed by smooth strings that overlap and are staggered, creating a definitely noteworthy effect to this noteworthy song. To say the least, I'm glad to be <b>graced</b> by the presence of this album.</p>

      <p>Favorite song: <b>13 Angels Standing Guard 'Round the Side of Your Bed</b>, or <b>For Wanda</b>..</p>
