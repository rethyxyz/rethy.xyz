				A fantastic album from 2001. Imogen Heap and Guy Sigsworth. A two piece short lived largely Britsh ensemble. Only one album, being this one, Details. Experimental and minimal electronica. Heavily based around vocals supported by reverberating background instrumentation to uplift, and accentuate.

				An album without much immediate mainstream success. Instead, it developed cult followings years after. Particularly nowadays. I believe the project was a sort of side one, not meant to be long term, but to be more experimental, or, more specifically, non-compromising.

				Initial cult-like groupings populated after the release of 2004 film <i>Garden State</i> by Zach Braff. The song <i>Let Go</i> (track 1) was played at film end, sparking people to seek out the name of the song played. Later, after accessibility, this became a devisor within, separating those-in-the-know prior to, being "superior", and those in post, as lesser.
