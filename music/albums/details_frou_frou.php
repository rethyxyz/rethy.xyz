			<p>A fantastic album from 2001. Imogen Heap and Guy Sigsworth. A two piece short lived largely Britsh ensemble. Only one album, being Details. Experimental and minimal electronica. Heavily based around vocals supported by reverberating background instrumentation to uplift, and accentuate.</p>

			<p>An album lacking immediate mainstream success. Instead, it developed cult followings years after. Particularly during the mid-2000s. I believe the project was a sort of side one, not meant to be long term, but to be more experimental, or, more specifically, non-compromising.</p>

			<p>Initial cult-like groupings populated after the release of the 2004 film <i>Garden State</i> created by Zach Braff. The song <i>Let Go</i> (first track) played at films end, sparking people to seek out the name of the song. Later, after accessibility was established, the movie became a devisor within, separating those-in-the-know prior to, being "superior", and those in post, as lesser.</p>

				I only thing I really dislike about the album is shit lyrics. Lyrics range from romantic relationship, to desire. Boring, and generic.
