                <i>Burial</i>. <i>Untrue</i>. 2007. The classic album defining
                the UK deep city sound.
            </p>

            <p>
                My first exposure to Burial came from the album
                <i>Mt. Eden</i>: <i>Mt Eden Album</i>. It was a remix of
                <i>Archangel</i>. I liked it from the start. Only in 2014 or so
                did I discover the origin album, <i>Untrue</i>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Nice album. Categorized by a perfect display of drum
                programming, and floaty, low-budget vocals. Never full vocals
                either. Just snippets. Each song is really similar in mixing
                and overall production. This isn't a bad thing. The end result
                is a centered and conceptual album surrounded around clever
                mixing.
            </p>

            <p>
                From what I've heard, the creator is an alledged audio
                engineer, which explains the atypicality of the end mixing and
                drum production. The "creator", William Emmanuel Bevan, made
                the album using an audio editor called X, not a Digital Audio
                Workstation (DAW). This is not an easy feat, fueling the the
                overall cult-status surrounding <i>Untrue</i>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many of the samples on the album seems to have been taken from
                YouTube. I'm sure you can find links to them somewhere on the
                Internet.
            </p>

            Favorite song: <b>Homeless, or Untrue (title track)</b>
