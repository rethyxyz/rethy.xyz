        <small>This album cover is okay.</small>
      </p>

      <p>I've heard this album a lot. As somewhat of a fan of the grunge era, I enjoyed the classic bands like Nirvana, The Smashing Pumpkins, Stone Temple Pilots, Silverchair (arguably post-grunge), etc... But I never got into Alice in Chains. Not out of hatred, but simply out of lack of exposure. Of course, I had heard their popular song "The Rooster", and enjoyed it. Not overly, but I thought it was intriguing.</p>

      <b>Would</b> is the song that made me want to listen to them. I forget how I heard it, but it was really good. Vocally, it was nice. Had a nice intro. Good bassline. The switch up towards the end is very nice as well. All around a good track.

      <p>I put on the album, and listened through it, deciding that much of is good, and much of it is (terribly) bad. But the good, shines through... Good songs: <b>Them Bones</b> (it's the worst of the high end), <b>Rooster</b>, <b>Rain When I Die</b>, <b>Down in a Hole</b>, and <b>Would?</b>. All else is shit. That's just the truth. I get why I've never heard of any acclaim for their albums as a whole. Much of it is a total flop. The bad is bluesy sounding, descending chord progression trash. The bad was really inconsistent from song. Variety isn't a bad thing, but in this case it is.</p>

      <p>Besides the album, the songs that shine, shine bright. Bad album, with some good songs, is how I'd describe it in one sentence.</p>
