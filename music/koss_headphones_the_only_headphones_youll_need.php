<h1>Koss Headphones: The Only Headphones You'll Ever Need</h1>
<small><b>Created: 2020-01-27 | Modified: 2020-01-28</b></small>

<p><font_red>Note</font_red>: I say <b>need</b>. I don't mean that other headphones are useless or bad, it's just that you only <b>need</b> Koss headphones. So please, don't flame me.</p>

<p>Koss headphones are the best headphones money can buy concerning price to performance. I'm not the only one who agrees. Most audiophiles agree that Koss headphones, especially the Porta Pro and KSC75, are the best entry-level audiophile headphones money can buy. Some prefer the KSC75 for it's wide soundstage and detailed high-end, others the Porta Pro for its dynamic range and well-rounded sound quality.</p>

<h2>My Personal Recommendation</h2>
<p>Buy the KSC75. I own a UR40, Porta Pro, and a KSC75. The KSC75s have the best sound by far. It's surprising that they're only $26.00 dollars (CAD), which is half of the price of a UR40, and a third of the price of Porta Pros. Once you try them, you won't think about buying any other headphone.</p>

<h2>Monetarily Cheap</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Porta Pro: $76.00 dollars (CAD).</li>
<li>UR40: $56.00 dollars (CAD).</li>
<li>KSC75: $26.00 dollars (CAD). Personally, these sound the best.</li>
</ul>
Koss also has a (limited) lifetime warranty. If you break 'em, just send them to Koss and they'll repair them for free (just pay $10.00 CAD shipping). I've owned my Porta Pro for 4 years and they still work great. I've owned the KSC75 for almost 2 years, and my UR40 for 2 months, and they still work great too. So far, no degradation whatsoever aside from the ear pads on my Porta Pros.
</p>

<h2>Huge Selection</h2>
<p>Porta Pros, KSC75s, UR40s, and KPH30i. These are just a few of their affordable headphones, which, for the most part, are completely unknown to the general consumer and anyone not in the know.

Not the most stylish. Koss headphones are function over form.

<h2>Audiophile Grade</h2>
<p>As I said in the first section, the headphones I mentioned are audiophile grade. If you don't trust me, take it from this pro. headphone reviewer:<br><br>

<h2>Comfort</h2>
<p>Koss's Headphones are super-lightweight, mainly because of the tiny amount of material used for the frame of the headphones. The headphones I mentioned are really just two headphone drivers with a thin cover. The Porta Pro sits lightly on your head, not gripping tightly, as not to cause strain. The KSC75 clips on your ear, which is the most comfortable in my opinion. I can wear the KSC75 for hours on end and usually even forget I'm wearing them.</p>

<h2>Moddable</h2>
<p>Because of the low price and cheap plastic (yet durable) design of their headphones, they are very easily modded.<br><br>
