<p>Koss headphones are the best headphones money can buy concerning price and performance. I'm not the only one who agrees. Most audiophiles agree along with me, that Koss headphones - specifically the Porta Pro and KSC75s - are the best entry-level audiophile headphones money can buy. Some prefer the KSC75 for it's wide soundstage and focused high-end, others the Porta Pro for its overall dynamic range and well-rounded sound quality.</p>

<h2>My Personal Recommendation</h2>
<p>If you want a clear answer, buy the KSC75s. I own a pair of UR40s, Porta Pros, and a KSC75. The KSC75s have by far the best sound (for what I listen to). It's surprising that they're only $26.00 dollars (CAD), which is half of the price of a UR40, and a third of the price of Porta Pros.</p>

<h2>Monetarily Cheap (Not in Sound Quality)</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Porta Pro: $76.00 dollars (CAD).</li>
<li>UR40: $56.00 dollars (CAD).</li>
<li>KSC75: $26.00 dollars (CAD). Personally, these are the best.</li>
</ul>
Koss has a (limited) lifetime warranty. If you break 'em, just send them to Koss and they'll repair them for free (just pay $10.00 CAD shipping), or they'll send you a brand new pair. I've owned my Porta Pro for 4 years and they still work great. I've owned my pair of KSC75 for almost 2 years now, my UR40 for 2 months, and they still work great too. So far, no degradation whatsoever aside from the ear pads on my Porta Pros.

<h2>Selection</h2>
<p>
Porta Pros, KSC75s, UR40s, and KPH30i. These are a few of their most affordable headphones, which, for the most part, are completely unknown to the general consumer and anyone not in the know.</p><br>

<p>Not the most stylish. Koss headphones are function over form.</p>

<h2>Audiophile Grade</h2>
<p>
  As I said in the first section, the headphones I mentioned are audiophile grade. If you don't trust me, take it from this pro. headphone reviewer:<br><br>

<h2>Comfort</h2>
<p>Koss's Headphones are super-lightweight, mainly because of the tiny amount of material used for the frame of the headphones. The headphones I mentioned are really just two headphone drivers within a thin plastic enclosure. The Porta Pro sits lightly on your head, not gripping tightly, as not to cause strain. The KSC75 clips on your ear, which is the most comfortable for me, but some others with larger ears say otherwise. I can wear the KSC75 for hours on end and usually forget I'm wearing them.</p>

<h2>Moddable</h2>
<p>Because of the low price and cheap plastic (yet durable) design of their headphones, they are very easily modded.<br><br>

This mod gives you two MMCX connectors for removable cables. I haven't tried any of this, but would like to one day.
