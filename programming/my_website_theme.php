<p>You may have noticed my unorthodox website design. It's very purposeful.</p>

<p>I care very little about aesthetics. I try to be purely functional in everything, especially concerning computing. I must enforce optimality, even if no one else does. That includes my website.</p>

<p>I believe this website has good design, mainly because it's focused around these design choices:
<ul>
<li><b>Contrasting colors</b>: <font color=red>R</font> <font color=green>G</font> <font color=blue>B</font> for headers (I only use <font color=red>h1</font>, <font color=green>h2</font>, and <font color=blue>h3</font>). It's a sort of mnemonic that allows you to see the hierarchy in case it isn't apparent to you already. Bold is colored in <font color=orange>orange</font>, as you can see.</li> 
<li><b>Easy to read, monospaced font:</b> Comprehensible. Not anti-aliased to oblivion and back. Compatible with all devices. Easy to render.</li>
<li><b>Back buttons on each page (aside from article pages)</b>: This makes navigation to and fro easy and simple, even if you're computer illiterate.</li>
<li><b>Just HTML and CSS</b>: No PHP, Javascript, or Perl. Everything is completely static.</li>
<li><b>No ads, no cookies, no trackers</b>: No spying will every be done on this website, or any of my websites.</li>
</ul>
