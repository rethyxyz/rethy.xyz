      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Hallstatt culture, named after its <a href="..\literature\term_definitions.html">type site</a>. </p>
      <!-- TODO: insert gallean/??? swords here-->
      <!--<img src="">-->

      <p>
      Categorized as:
      <ul>
      <li>Widely farming communities</li>
      <li>Highly-advanced metal-working</li>
      <li>Long-range trade within the area and with Mediterranean cultures towards end of Hallstatt</li>
      <li>Tribal based (little is known)</li>
      <li>Villages
      <ul>
      <li>Only a few, such as Heuneburg in the south of Germany, were considered towns rather than villages</li></li>
      </ul>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>A period emphasizing social distinction, in an age of clashing elite classes of chieftains and warriors.</p>

      <h2>Languages</h2>
      <p>Most if not all languages spoken were Celtic-type.</p>

      <h2>Civilizations</h2>
      <p>
      Categorized as:
      <ul>
      <li>Forts situated on hill tops</li>
      <li>Approximately the size of a small modern village</li>
      <li>Workshops of bronze-, silver-, and goldsmiths</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Burials</h2>
      <!-- TODO: tumuli burial goes here ("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hochdorf_Chieftain%27s_Grave") -->
      <p>Important persons had large graves, sometimes a chamber with a hill was build upon them called a <a href="..\literature\term_definitions.html">tumuli</a>. Inside of these there were weapons, pottery, jewellery, and other items of importance. Occasionally, there were chariot burials, where a chariot - with the horses, if I may add - was buried with them.</p>

      <h2>Trade</h2>
      <p>Trade with Greece was common, proven through finding <a href="">black ink art</a> at burial sites. Trade items included amber, ivory, and wine.</p>
