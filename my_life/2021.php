			<h1>My Life in 2021</h1>
			<p>
				This page essentially serves as a change log and a way to display what I'm doing.
				I post here occasionally.

				<p>
					Another update to the website, this time, core functionality:
				</p>

				<p>
					It's starting to get difficult to manage so many sub-pages, especially when I want to change the site theme (unfortunately, I do this often).
					Each time I do, I have to change the settings on each individual page, which takes a while because there's around 100.
					If I modify a page, I also have to change the date, which sometimes I forget to do.
					This gets anoying after a while.
					I solved this by implementing PHP, pretty much just for PHP includes, and dynamic modification date.
					I no longer need to write the modification date, as it's taken from the metadata of the file.
				</p>

				<p>
					I'm glad to have implemented this, as it should increase my productivity in the future, and (hopefully) with less micro-management later.

				<p>
					I've been AFK (really just away from my website) for approximately 4 days as I was playing runescape.
					I take a hiatus every once in a while if I get burnt out from programming, which is what happened recently.
					I believe I spent 14-16 of my waking hours playing some sort of game.
					Overall, it was a good time.
					As I was using Windows 7, I now have more content as to how you can still use Windows 7 in 2021 safely.
					People don't know, but Windows 7 is still given security updates, but only for enterprise users.
					I'll show this off later.

				<p>
					New page <a href="../computing/about_rms_website.php">about richard stallman's website</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					I've been working hard on creating some new scripts:
				</p>

				<p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>YouTube channel to RSS feed (yt2rss.sh)</b>: Fetches YouTube channel ID from URL (generates RSS readable URLS)</li>
						<li><b>Wallaper randomizer</b>: Chooses a random wallpaper from ~/pix/wallpapers/ directory and sets it using <code>feh</code></li>
					</ul>
					You can find these on my GitHub page.

			<p>
				Added a page dedicated to my recycle bin: <a href="../programming/my_linux_recycle_bin.php">rethyxyz-recycle-bin</a>. It's made to imitate the Windows recycle bin, but for Linux. I also added an <a href="../computing/obscure_linux_errors.php">obscure linux errors</a> page. It'll serve as a repository of the error fixes I've run into in the past, mostly focusing on the obscure ones.
			</p>

			<p>
				I still have a lot of articles to write.
			</p>

			<p>
				I revised my article categories, now opting to have no sub-categories.
				When you click on a category, such as computing, you will now see no sub-pages, like Linux.
				All articles are now displayed from newest to oldest.
				I also changed the global site font to monospace.
			</p>

			<section>
			<small><b>2021-02-24 at 17:53:33</b></small>

			<p>
				I recently posted an article called <a href="../programming/my_website_theme.php">rethy.xyz Website Theme</a> where I outline my website theme, specifically my themeing constants.
			</p>

			<p>
				<ul>
					<li><del><b>TODO</b> Make a bash_aliases to vimrc format converter</del></li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<section>
			<small><b>2021-02-23 at 00:09:46</b></small>

			<p>
				I have lots to do.
				Still plently of articles to write, and many more coming.
				It seems the next thing I'll be doing is a few more music articles.
			</p>

			<p>
				One on:
				<ul>
					<li><del><b>TODO</b> Details by Frou Frou</del></li>
					<li><b>TODO</b> S/T by Elliott Smith</li>
					<li><del><b>TODO</b> Diorama by Silverchair</del></li>

			<section>
			<small><b>2021-02-22 at 01:32:21</b></small>
			<p>
				Added <a href="..\programming\taking_notes_in_html.php">Taking Notes in html</a> page.
				It's something I started doing recently, and have been enjoying it a lot.
				It's also nice being able to insert images into my note pages for once, as I had been using vim-wiki prior and for a long time.
			</p>

			<section>
			<small><b>2021-02-18 at 8:23 PM</b></small>

			<p>
				Added <a href="../visual_media/apetor.php">Apetor</a>, <a href="../visual_media/amelie.php">Amelie</a>, and <a href="../visual_media/andrew_wood_documentary.php">Andrew Wood</a> pages to <a href="../visual_media/index.php">visual media</a> area.
			</p>

			<p>
				Lots more content coming soon. I'm currently working on:
			</p>

			<p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>TODO</b> The Oxford comma</li>
				<li><b>TODO</b> Pig Latin 101</li>
				<li><b>TODO</b> File organizational guidelines</li>
				<li><b>TODO</b> Mongolia</li>

			<section>
			<small><b>2021-02-12 at 12:45 PM</b></small>

			<p>
				Now added history page.
				Currently focusing on Central Europe (Celts).
			</p>
			</section>



			<section>
			<small><b>2021-02-12 at 1:49 AM</b></small>

			<p>
				Simplified <a href="../computing/an_efficient_vim.php">An Efficient <code>vim</code></a> page.
				I removed most of the text talking about each index, it's redundant.
				Each one, except for the first, is added to your <code>.vimrc</code>, which is obvious, so I don't need to write it each time.
			</p>

			<p>
				Some things I need to research and learn:
				<ul>
					<li><b>TODO</b> Human genetics: DNA/Haplogroups</li>
					<li><b>TODO</b> Go programming</li>
					<li><b>TODO</b> The history of Europe (doing hallstatt culture a - d right now)</li>
					<ul>
						<li><b>TODO</b> Gauls</li>
						<li><b>TODO</b> The formation of Latin</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>I'm currently writing a comprehensive guide of Hallstatt culture A - D (late Bronze Age to early Iron Age). Eventually I'll create an entire guide to Central Europe, going from start of Bronze Age all the way to the Roman Period.</p>

			<p>I have another on the go about Great Apes. It's a compendium of every <a href="..\literature\term_definitions.php">extant</a> Great Ape. Upon completion, I may convert it to HTML or embed the PDF into this website (it's being written in LaTeX).</p>

			<p>Some reminders so I don't forget about completing them:
				<ul>
					<li><b>TODO</b> Great Apes paper</li>
					<li><b>TODO</b> LaTeX basics; How to get started writing LaTeX</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<small><b>2021-02-10 at 2:16 PM</b></small>

			<p>
				Updated <a href="../computing/my_windows_10_setup.php">My Windows 10 Setup</a> page to reflect my current setup.
			</p>

			<p>
				I'm also working on a data forwarding system to work with <a href="../programming/moses_rat.php">moses.rat</a>.
				I want it to run as a service on a server, which will forward the information sent from the remote controller onto the next server with the service, which will send it onto the next, and so on.
				This'll create a sort of proxy system so you don't have to directly connect with the CnC.
				It's not yet complete, but you can find it on my <a href="https://github.com/rethyxyz/">GitHub</a> under the repository <a href="https://github.com/rethyxyz/command_chain">command_chain</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Don't forget, it's for research purposes only.
			</p>

			<p>
				Beside that, I need to update the moses.rat page to include some infographs of it in action.
			</p>

			<br>

			<p>
				<b>TODO</b> Update moses.rat page to include infographics of the thing in action (screenshot of desktops, and remote command execution).
			</p>
			</section>



			<section>
			<small><b>2021-02-09 at 12:31 AM</b> (exact same time as last)</small>

			<p>
				I'm finally pushing somewhat of a final theme for this website.
				I ended up opting for straight lines rather than round ones for the boxes and such.
			</p>

			<br>

			<p>
				<del><b>TODO</b> Add koss_headphones page to music and hardware index</del>
			</p>

				<del><b>TODO</b> Add windows software page to windows index</del>

			</p>

			<p>
				I'm currently overtaking a big overhaul of my website.
				It's going to be much improved, and will be made to support more content than just articles.
				As shown by this page, I'll also have a sort of updates page showing what I'm doing, or for my future self to eventually do.
				The latter will be in the form of TODOs.
				You will see those eventually.
